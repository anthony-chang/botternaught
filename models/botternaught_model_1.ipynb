Thanks for sharing the infographic.  I agree that consent is \"the big change\".  I think there are a lot of little edge-cases surrounding consent that are going to make those waters tricky to navigate.  For instance, getting consent before storing the user's IP address.  Every webserver I've ever worked with stores IP address in the access log by default.  How much trouble are companies willing to go through to gather consent prior to allowing their web server to log that IP address, or will they just remove that from the logs and make sys-admins and developers hate their lives? \n","1761 Im not a designer in the slightest, but I wanted to do what little I can to support whats happening right now in the US.\n","\n","Source - [Washington Post Police Shootings Dataset](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings)\n","\n","The site was using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) a static site generator for VueJS, for anyone interested. hahaha, your not the first person I've heard of that happening to, maybe I should color code the operations, so each one is more visually distinct.

For the NN thats actually just one of like a dozen inputs it uses. I used a bunch of different stats like your standard win %, elo, map strength, also I derived a couple of useful stats. Everything was scrapped from over.gg(thank you to them).

Hessisch on the other side (I speak it myself) is easier to understand because many young people can't speak it properly anymore. My mom's from a village and she still speaks hessian.

Also, I think that anything lighter than a very dark wash jean looks a bit too casual for work.

No guarantee we carry weight the same way or have similar body types, but every time I put on a pair of joggers I am disappointed by how they look. If you have worn other joggers and like the style, I'd go for it. If you haven't, since you obviously can't try on that exact pair, maybe a trip to a store that sells that cut of pant to try them on might help you decide? Congrats! Well done!

You are allowed to lay around the house and just watch tv and cuddle your pet while wearing a shirt that makes you look and feel like a million bucks. It can always be washed or dry cleaned if you spill something on it, and you can use a roller to get off any pet hair. Those things are yours to enjoy however you see fit, messy life or not.\n","\n","Hugs. Oof, at the institution where I work adjuncts can only teach at most 7 classes per year (3 one semester and 4 the next unless we have special permission for 4/4 for a single year) and we only make 2k per class, so it tops out at 14k. Summer classes don't count toward that total, but are much more likely to get cancelled so can't be relied upon even when they're offered. We are able to work up to 15 hours in a non-teaching position (tutoring or part-time advising, which is hard to get) but the number of hours we can work is dictated by the number of classes we're teaching. For example, if I am teaching 3 classes, I can only tutor for 8.75 hours, and while the pay for some of those positions is decent, it doesn't add up to much with those limits in place. I fully support and appreciate unions, but the unions at my specific institution don't include adjuncts or part-time staff, so those employees always get the short end of the stick despite making up more than 75% of the positions at the institution. It makes both making money and getting hired into a full-time position exceedingly difficult. Adjuncting, especially at the beginning, is a lot of work for (often) very little compensation. It takes a TON of time to set up and prepare for a class, and once it starts students are often needy and require a lot of your time (or are absent and also require a time investment if you're expected to reach out like many CCs expect). In addition, depending on your department, there may not be a ton of support for new faculty. It is absolutely not sustainable in the long-term as a \"real\" job. That said, if you have free time, enjoy your subject, and find that you enjoy teaching, it can be incredibly fun and rewarding. If you happen to join a really good team, as well, it's even better. I have worked as an adjunct for years and I've loved every minute of my community college experience, so if you have a decent amount of spare time I'd say it's worth checking out. CC tutoring is also fun and rewarding if you want to just dip your toes in without committing to a full 16 week class. Thank you for your recommendations! What books has she done?

Since I like change, I mostly just buy samples, use them up, and move on to the next color. Confirmed That color suits her perfectly and this picture is just adorable. Yes my coloring is the same and I agree 100%. Beautiful! Pm Pm Confirmed I'm envious! I thought about requesting one, but I don't want to spend $5 on shipping for a catalogue. Love it! Hahahaha that is hilarious 🤷‍♀️ Covid and flu have proven to be vastly different, so it doesn't make sense to make an assumption of one based on the other. And like I said, while the expectation is certainly that grade schools would be a hotbed of infection, it doesn't seem to be the case now that people have had time to actually observe the incidence of infection and spread among school age children. One of these studies (maybe the one in England? Idr now.) explains that when infections have occurred in schools, it was mostly adult-to-adult. There is less known so far about the impact on community spread, but thus far the evidence is confounding expectations regarding kids and covid infection.\n","\n","Here are just a few. A quick search will find you a bunch of recent articles summarizing these and other studies that have been done in the last three months, as well. I think the one I read that led me down this rabbit hole was in the NYT? Maybe? Idk. I've been following it all closely as I have four kids, and while their school is currently fully remote, keeping them home vs sending them to school in person is a decision I'll have to make at some point.  \n","\n","https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e2.htm?s_cid=mm6939e2_w\n","\n","https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.38.2001645\n","\n","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.21.20178574v1 Interestingly, head lice is not a disease. As far as infection goes, not all diseases spread the same way among age populations, and in this instance studies are showing that this coronavirus is spread more readily among adults and that adults get sicker for longer and carry higher viral loads. Personally, I'm glad that (responsible) officials are leaning on science rather than outraged reddit posters who think they know more than epidemiologists. \n","1827 Do some side quests for some extra money, or good items. But the main quest has the good shouts. I saw a floating mammoth. It was just walking in the air. Took me about 5 minutes. I wanted to play too bad.\n"," \n","1828 Hold up, is this guy Greek? I did the same and then sent an extended email to WWE Corporate fan account. I doubt it will be read or replied to, but it's still important I just want Chris Jericho to go away. Anytime I see a story about him or watch him wrestle, I just wish he'd take a break from everything. I can't put my finger on what it is, but a lot of it is him still trying to be cool. When I was about 3 or 4, my dad was out of work. He would stay home with me and do chores around the house and clean. \n","\n","I was playing Mike Tyson's Punchout on the Nintendo, I wasn't great but I had fun playing it. Whenever I got knocked down, I couldn't mash the buttons fast enough to get back up. I would shout for my dad, who would stop whatever he was doing and run over to mash the buttons and get me back up. \n","\n","I don't have very few memories before the age of 5, but that is one that sticks in my brain. The amount of people who seem to think that putting Drew McIntyre directly into a feud with Brock, Roman or Braun is a little ridiculous. Is that what you really want? You want him to be fodder on the main roster immediately?\n","\n","People seem to have this glorious idea that NXT stars should be top tier draws immediately. A good portion of the audience doesn't know who he is. Pairing him with Ziggler is amazing. He looks huge next to Ziggler and they can establish him as a massive threat, without having to have him lose each week to Braun or Roman. Give it time, not every NXT champion needs to be World Champion a week after being called up. The double team move, the revival missed off the top rope, was the one that they messed up. I can understand that a bit, but why is that on the Rock? I mean he seems to be the one getting sh*t on all over Wreddit. You think he walked in and suggested a 6 second match against Rowan and then have Cena come save him. I think Wreddit loves to personally railroad people into the ground for things that are suggested from the top.\n","\n","To be fair, how else are we supposed to voice our displeasure at something like that? We have to boo the person, because creative isn't walking out there to have a Q and A session.\n","\n","As for Nakamura and Zayn. I think they did tell a story. We both seem to agree it wasn't 5 stars. I wasn't attempting to imply by that they didn't tell a story, by saying another match did. I think the outcry for it to be a 5-star match was a bit over the top. Still a great match. At the Hall of Fame inductions he appeared to be drunk in an interview with Renee. He was all over the place in an answer and looked visibly disheveled. Which maybe that's what he is good at and what he's willing to do, which is fantastic. I think that is the point. But WWE seems to emphasize, make your opponent look good, but not too good. It's odd because they love entertainment over wrestling and Ziggler goes for that gusto. I've had a few things building up so here goes:\n","\n","\n","Nakamura vs. Zayn wasn't a 5 star match.  It was good, it lived up to the hype, but it wasn't 5 stars.  I don't need to see 5 minutes of back and forth forearms to get that the guy is \"strong style.\"  The closest to a 5 star match that night was the tag title match.  It had story telling, intrigue, and with the exception of the one mistake, was almost flawless.\n","\n","\n","Fuck PG? Really?  You're very edgy.  \"It's for storytelling.\" What about his health? The fact that it could blind him and make the match even more dangerous.  Stop being childish.\n","\n","\n","I love Sasha Banks, but she was off at Wrestlemania.  She just seemed a little lost and the match felt overly choreographed and scripted, having said that,I wasn't huge on Becky Lynch before, but afterwards I was fully on board with her.  I was very impressed.\n","\n","\n","Ambrose sucked in his buildup to Mania with Lesner.  You're getting to go one-on- one with one of the best ever on the mic, in Paul Heyman, and you come off looking like an amateur.  Want your match to go longer than 10 minutes? Don't appear drunk the night before your match, live, to thousands of people.\n","\n","\n","The Rock and Cena part of the night was awesome.  Being in the audience, and hearing that place go nuts for all the legends returning was awesome.  If you're complaining about the Rock burying another talent, I'll just refer you to the way the Wyatts have been booked, since they started.  It's a pay-per-view, guess what, they're going to lose.  And Bray chose Eric Rowan to take on the Rock, what else do you expect from \"The Eater of Pins\" in the Wyatt Family.\n","\n","\n","You know why the league of nations got \"buried\" by a bunch of guys from the attitude era? First, they took some finishers, after a challenging match with the New Day.  on top of that, yes, three of the greatest legends in the history of wrestling would probably trump a few guys(granted some multi-time world champions) who are tired after wrestling a match.  Also, stop tossing around the word buried.\n","\n","\n","If you still hate Ryback because of CM Punk, just stop.  It's pointless.  If he was overly dangerous, the WWE wouldn't let him wrestle.  He's gotten better with his in-ring ability since then.  He's not going to be the best promo guy, but then again, that hasn't stopped anybody from being an above average performer.\n","\n","\n","The Miz is one of the best heels all-time.  Especially in an era when we as the fans cheer heels, and boo faces, this guy has got it figured out.  It would be difficult to find many heels in the WWE who are as over, as a heel, as The Miz is.\n","\n","\n","Admittedly I'm a Ziggler mark.  The thing that gets me the most is the anti-Ziggler sentiment around here.  He's been booked soooo horribly.  We can get past the, he took Roman's spot at Survivor Series, I don't really care if he did or didn't.  You know, as well as I do, that was an incredible performance, and he would've beaten Rollins without Sting anyway.  The WWE had him over, again, and decided to have him disappear for two months, and bring him back with another wrestler at the front of the pack. \"But he oversells.\"  He did, once upon a time.  When I watch now, he sells the right amount, he's not bouncing up and and down on the mat, flopping like a fish.  If he lands on his arm, he sells the arm, unlike most.  But this nonsense of overselling has been done for a while.\n","\n","\n","If you're tired of seeing Ziggler on your tv screen, I don't know what to tell you.  The guy makes other wrestlers look good, and for the past couple years, he's stayed healthy.  But if you think guys like, Ambrose, Rollins, Zayn and Owens should be pushed, Ziggler should be on that list too.  You fawn over workers from back in the Attitude era who made others look good, but you want to sh*t on Ziggler, and cry out for Steve Blackman returns.\n","\n","\n","I realized at Mania that this r/SquaredCircle can be a bit of a dump.  When I first started out with r/SquaredCircle, and maybe I'm remembering wrong, but there felt like a lot more fun discussion and back and forths regarding wrestling.  Now it's boiled down to who can crack the best one-liner first, and everybody trashing other wrestlers.  What's the point?  Those of you saying it's a conversation, it's not.  There is usually a back and forth, but it's tough to see because if you disagree with an opinion, you downvote it, which is not the way it is supposed to work.  If they got a fact wrong, that doesn't necessarily invalidate the whole point, correct them, you'll get your upvotes and then see what happens next, but downvoting someone to oblivion, because you disagree with what they've said, doesn't change the conversation, it just keeps the same points at the top of every argument.\n","\n","\n","Also DAE posts are dumb, you're not alone, unless, you're asking, DAE hate their view of Mania, from section 201, row M, seat 6, at AT&T stadium?  At that point, then yes, there probably wasn't anybody else.\n","\n","\n","Also, you know who I never liked as a kid? Bret Hart.  The guy had the charisma of a piece of card board when not wrestling.  I'm not taking away from the fact that he was incredible in the ring, but the personality was lacking anytime that he picked up a mic.  Owen was better on the mic, and on par in the ring, and if he had the look, he would've been pushed toward the stars.  Also, when you are leaving a job and everyone knows, sometimes you have to train somebody else to take over your responsibilities.  You don't get to say when you'll let them take your job, not how it works.  The heat it would've generated for Michaels to take the title in Montreal would've been fantastic.  I don't care if you hate the guy, you're leaving and won't have to deal with him anymore.  Drop the title when they ask you to and move on.\n","\n","Sorry, It's been a rough week. Favorite thing from the girlfriend: So they're like a VooDoo Duck Dynasty thing? What a great match. Dolph and KO have been putting on show after show this past month.\n","\n","I always find it funny that we love ideas like Benoit vs. Booker T in a seven match series and yet complain about having to see Dolph vs. Owens for the 4th time in as many weeks. Yet they haven't had a bad match. I miss Dolph Ziggler on my TV. \n","\n","And all of you people that hate him...are entitled to your opinion. Just remember I strongly disagree with you and I hope you step on a Lego today. Taker does what old school wrestling used to do. An entire match should tell a story. Just awesome. I like to think HHH and Sting came to an agreement to have Charles Robinson as the referee.  Stardust looks sinister. The only way I would care about this Cena vs. Rusev match, is if was in Moscow, on Christmas. 2014 was a rough year overall.  But I finally got a new car yesterday and shared Christmas eve with a wonderful woman.  I'm excited for 2015. The talent on that roster is just incredible. Those top two lines, just amazing. I've bought the last 4 Ziggler shirts. I remove the WWE tag and I wear them once in a while. Working out or running errands, occasionally out to the bar. \n","\n","The pink one and the stealing the show and your girlfriend shirt have gotten me the most compliments out of any of the pieces of clothing I have.\n","\n","I'm not the best looking guy by any means, but they're playful and fun, and they actually help start conversations. If you don't care or you have the confidence, you can pull off any piece of clothing...except jorts, nobody is pulling those off. One of my favorite songs is the last track on Highway to Hell, the song Night Prowler. It is a song completely different from what you guys had been producing at that point. An incredible song that combines blues and rock.\n","\n","Was that a throwaway song at the end of the album? Was it just riffing in the studio? What was the inspiration behind the lyrics from Bon?\n","\n","Cheers fellas. Rusev kills Henry and then Show challenges Rusev to a fight on Christmas in Russia, calling it. I'm giving Raw an hour. If the Bella's open hour two or three, I'm out...unless Dolph is advertised in the main event That's a worse leg drop than Hogan's. \n","1829 Good luck with the project.

There is very good chance you will get someone. Just remember that if you are financially not doing well, you will suffer from that.  Hmm, \n","\n","It did not take just that. I do not drink alcohol altogether, that alone does boost that commitment.. too many people nowadays start smoking after drinking, then after the hangover they keep enjoying the smoke. I was relapsing the same way almost every time.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","In the realm to quit, i gave up on caffeine (including tee) and alcohol. I came back to caffeine, but kept off alcohol. For 10 years now I do not drink or smoke.\n","\n","Besides I do not see myself as a dedicated person, which explains alone why it took me almost 50 attempt to succeed, instead I was convinced that smoke and alcohol would robe me of almost everything. What I would do:\n","\n","To make the situation little bit interesting I would get angry very much, show that I am leaving that area, before coming back and getting on my knees and asking if she would marry me. In Finland it is easy to get a 15 years old small car for only $1000. But tax and insurance for that year will require an overall $1800, or little less depending on the car and the experience of the driver, but is around that price.\n","\n","Usually there is a compulsory security check every two years, usually for cheaper cars  time  is in less that one year left . Depending on the luck of the customer, a repair might be over the price of the car, in which case the car becomes  garbage, unless repairing and reselling sounds like a plane, usually not good for old cars.  It took me almost 50 tries to quit smoking before i succeeded. It involved a lot of energy and brought pretty much frustration. Now that i am not biased by smoking anymore, it is unfathomable to me how cigarettes are still legally sold in grocery stores, just like food. Meanwhile a lot of beneficial substances are utterly forbidden.  The most efficient method is to use any diplomatic pressure  against the Saudi government. That government can annihilate a whole nation to secure remaining in power.  Made my day: Staying in the same day is worst than death itself. The look in her face is priceless.

I really did not know that Ireland is that much concerned with Human Right! From North to South Korea, a net difference of 80 point, The biggest gape between two neighbor countries. Are her eyebrows black?\n","\n","&#x200B; Really this boils down to few things. First and foremost, this products of nature cannot be patented in anyway, making it rather harmful for pharmaceutical companies, as it might basically reduce the credibility and sale of their patented products. Furthermore this naturally occurring substances  get caught in a fierce war against Drugs.\n","\n","Despite being used for thousands of years by many civilizations, and despite some very beneficial use, like an almost immediate help for cluster headaches, they remain in the shadow. Instead buying an addictive and harmful substance like cigarette can be done at a local food store, with smokes of flavors all the ways to the lungs.\n","\n","&#x200B; I did not know that this could happen. Last most weirdo thing about mushroom i even seen was related to mushroom growing from the head of an ant. The growing process starts while the ant still alive. Ants are aware of such infection and they start caring away ants with such condition.

In the same time, most productivity is usually exacerbated by kids presence.. This is surprising!\n","\n","By 2060 Poland will be older (median) than Germany by two years. Turkey is almost equally getting old, even though at a slightly slower rate. This seems to touch almost every country. That is definitely the case, especially in the dark blue countries. That is until when it comes to minorities, either for being trusted or for trusting others. So that information is quite a good approximation, but one should exclude minorities, otherwise the figures could be very misleading, leading to huge disparities..\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","it's quite funny when countries like Finland and Denmark (again dark blue here), was claimed the best countries to live in. Personally i was not sure how this could really be the case. A decade later i saw in the news paper, that \"the country is the best place to live in, also for foreigners\".

It's not like life is a race and you must win it no matter what. In the end we all have one thing in common. We all die someday. Wheter you make millions doing something or you are just having fun.

Also if u can prove that with some kind of reliable source, i have to admit that it´s pretty fucking sad on FROM´s side to do that instead of fixing their code or whatever is causing it yea repairing is your only choice. it doesn´t take too long either so you should be fine 10/10 it was mediocre at best - IGN sry for the late reply. i actually repaired it before because i thought it might help since i´ve experienced this issue for a longer time now but repairing the client didn´t help.. the client just crashes in lobby for example and then i have to restart i know what you mean, but it doesn´t fix itself for me which is pretty annoying. i can only close it manually and have to restart the client. \n","1843 Thank you!

I went on a tour at UVA that brought focus to how slaves were incorporated into the campus during its early years. One of the things that they brought up was how the walls were actually rather weak. They constantly had to repair them. In fact, when I was there, one of the curved walls had collapsed. However, the walls were good at absorbing sound. They surround areas where slaves would work, so it seems as though they were really used the walls to muffle the sound of working slaves. \n","\n","Now this is just what the tour guide said, and I couldn't find any sources to back it up. \n","\n","What I do know is that many attempts to obscure the presence of slave labor are evident in may of Jefferson's other architectural work. Monticello is an excellent example. Monticello had dumbwaiters and shelves on rotating doors that the slaves could use to indirectly serve the guests. All the things slaves needed to work were placed the basement, while living quarters for the owners and guests were on the second floor. There was also an extra clock on the east side of the house for the slaves to use, which only had an hour hand. Additionally, there were side entrances for the slaves to use that ensured that the guests would never cross paths with a slave.\n","\n","This tour was part of an effort to not forget that slaves built and ran the university early on, which was partially spurred on by the white supremacy riots that happened last year in Charlottesville.  \n","\n","You can read more about it here.\n","http://slavery.virginia.edu/\n","https://vpdiversity.virginia.edu/sites/vpdiversity.virginia.edu/files/documents/SlaveryatUVaBrochure_FINAL.pdf\n","\n","Source for Monticello stuff\n","https://www.monticello.org/slavery-at-monticello\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello\n"," No your lie in april fans here?

Looks like it's ~ $400 - $800 to ship. 1,200 miles is too far for me to ride on a sm. I wasn't planning on buying a bike, but I am interested and will need to do some research. I don't want to waste your time, so if you get another offer please by all means take it.  Do you have any idea how the fueling is compared to the carb version? I'd consider buying it to replace my wr250x, but I want my next bike to be capable of creeping slowly without using a ton of clutch. The few fuel injected supermotos I've tried including mine and a few ktms were really snatchy at low speed. Clothing that comes in tall sizes and stretchy dress shirts Myth: TFL I remember when I bought my programmer from FMF there was a list of suggested settings based on the bike's configuration. I'd check their website or email them and ask. Also, I'd suggest looking on superhero junkie for how to access CO settings. I played with those when I set up my bike and it seemed to make a noticeable difference. Accessing the menu involves attaching some relay under the seat to the battery. I can't remember exactly how. I did it using my battery tender cable. Is it possible that some people can't do them due to their body proportions?  I can do pistols with both feet even though my right ankle has way less flexible due to injury. Although, I must wear squat shoes and hold a 10kg plate out in front of me with arms fully extended to bring my center of gravity forward. I think my femurs are just too long to do them unassisted. If you're an engineer you should try a Sevcon instead of a Kelly. From what I've read they are much better, but much harder to program.  Athletic tape works. Hook. I thought everyone loved this movie, and was shocked to find out it has a 30% on rotten tomatoes and a 6.7 on imdb with a ton of scathing reviews. This was my first bike. I liked it a lot, but at 6'2\" it felt a bit small. I have an '01 C5. Like many others have said I've had a few electrical issues. Key switch shorted out, had to open it up and clean it. The passenger door connector is loose and has lost connection before. Brake module failed, kind of a pain to remove, but not too expensive to fix.\n","\n","One thing I haven't seen anyone mention is the crazy front overhang. This may be an issue specific to me.

You can often find stuff that's unavailable at domestic retailers like RevZilla and Motorcycle Superstore and it's often cheaper too. I did a quick search and found Gaerne SG 11 supermotos, but didn't see SG10's. Some people have issues with customer service and shipping though. I ordered a new pair of Sidi Crossfire 2's for $340 shipped vs. almost $600 US retail.  I had a blue '84 and liked it a lot. It was my second bike after a VTR250. It ended up stolen otherwise I might still have it. There are a few things I'll add: 1) If the carbs need maintenance it's a real pain. 30 year old rubber is rock hard and you can't find new boots to replace them with. If it runs fine and you ride it often this shouldn't be an issue though. 2) Mine developed a slight oil leak from the seal behind the clutch slave. From what I read this is fairly common. The '84 was badly designed here and the seal can't be replaced without splitting the case. This was changed for the '85 and '86. I just lived with it, but it was fairly annoying. 3) I loved having a center stand, all bikes should have center stands! 4) I'm the same height as you 6'2\", 190#. The ergos are mostly fine, but I much prefer my current taller ride. If I were ever to get another one I'd go for the '86 red white and blue color scheme, I always thought that one looked awesome.

If there are bolts/nuts visible, they are the back side. Snatch is definitely more technical, but it's a finesse lift. When you do a perfect snatch it looks and feels easy. Clean and jerk always takes everything you've got. C&J. The ultimate expression of strength, technique, and determination. I had the same bike, same year. I really enjoyed it until it was stolen. The issues that I had were, bad pulser coil, oil leak into the starter, and an oil leak behind the clutch slave. If you ever developer that same leak I suggest you just live with it. On the 84 there is a lip around that seal so you can only get at it from the inside, which means splitting the cases.  JCVD \n","1859 ...which is how the word \"knight\" was originally pronounced.

I'm a combat vet, and I'd certainly fight for my daughter every time, but I don't know what to defend against in this situation. Nothing in my daughter behavior or demeanor indicated anything was off. I don't suspect sexual abuse, which is why the title of the post is asking about legitimate reasons for blood in this he panties  I did ask her at the time. She didn't know. There was no pain, no bruising, no change in demeanor or behavior, nothing. Except when she went to go potty, I saw her panties. She didn't even know it was there and had felt nothing. I know my daughter very well and can tell when something is wrong or off, and she was completely normal. \n","\n","I do have full 50/50, and I have \"Right of First Refusal\" (where if her mother can't watch her, then I get her).

I retired to spend more time with my daughter. If I could have her 100%, I'd jump at the opportunity!

In the eyes of the court, however, I'm a \"trained killer with a history on mental health issues.\"  I was lucky to work toward full joint custody and it took me three years, starting with paying off duty cops $60/hour to watch me play in a park with my daughter for four hours. This is Florida, there's practically no way a judge would take a child away from her mother unless you had a signed, notarized confession with HD video of her mother abusing her or subjecting her to abuse.  I kept them sealed in a Ziploc baggie.  That's why my attorney advised me to hold off on CPS and that's why I asked here. Could there be, are there, legitimate reasons for blood to be in the panties?  She wasn't bruised, complaining of pain, and no other symptoms.  \n","1883 I've layered a few more hydrating gels.

In early 19th-century North Carolina judicial opinion about this question, of the limits of a master's authority over his slaves, was largely divided in two. While several judges were reluctant to admit that a slave had any rights whatsoever, others found that a master did not have the power to murder a slave for either sport or punishment.\n","\n","In State v. Boon (1802, 1 N.C. 191) Judge Hall wrote: \"a slave in a pure state of slavery has no rights...Sir William Blackstone in his Commentaries, Vol. I., 423, define pure slavery to be, that whereby an absolute power is given to the master, over the life and fortune of the slave...Slaves in this country possess no such rights; their condition is more abject; they are not parties to our constitution; it was not made for them.\"\n","\n","This sentiment was echoed by Justice Ruffin in State v. Mann (1829, 13 N.C. 263), who acknowledged a theoretical bound on the master's power, but declined to have the courts draw any enforceable line. \"That there may be particular instances of cruelty and deliberate barbarity, where, in conscience the law might properly interfere, is most probable. The difficulty is to determine, where a Court may properly begin...We cannot allow the right of the master to be brought into discussion in the Courts of Justice. The slave, to remain a slave, must be made sensible, that there is no appeal from his master\".\n","\n","A mere five years later, in State v. Will (1834, 18 N.C. 121), Justice Gaston moved the North Carolina Supreme Court in another direction by reiterating the rule that a master may not deliberately kill his slave, even as part of a slave's punishment. \"[U]nlimited power is, in general, the legal right of the master. Unquestionably there are exceptions to this rule...There is no legal limitation to the master's power of punishment, except that it shall not reach the life of his offending slave.\"\n","\n","Ruffin, edging back somewhat from his earlier position five years after that in State v. Hoover (1839, 20 N.C. 500), elaborated then on the restriction on killing in relation to punishment. \"But the master's authority is not altogether unlimited. He must not kill. There is, at the least, this restriction upon his power: he must stop short of taking life...If death unhappily ensue from the master's chastisement of his slave, inflicted apparently with a good intent\", the court would attempt to excuse the master's conduct. But a death resulting from \"[p]unishment...immoderate and unreasonable...accompanied by other hard usage and painful privations of food, clothing and rest\" would suggest that the master intended murder, and be unacceptable to the courts. Are fields that do not have any particles associated with them hypothesized to exist? I'll back this up with an excerpt by James Sheridan:\n","\n","> In fact, regionalism had traditionally flourished in China, even when central authority was strong. Geographic distinctiveness, economic interests, linguistic distinctions, ethnic and cultural patterns all fostered feelings of loyalty - of belonging - to regions. There was a system of 'layered loyalties': loyalties to the provinces, to multi-provincial regions, to intra-provincial regions, and to border-zone regions. But these were not normally political loyalties, which is why they could coexist with vigorous central power. Only when central authority collapsed did traditional regionalism acquire an important political dimension. The regional units that had cultural and economic importance in a unified China became the natural units into which the country disintegrated, and the natural territorial bases for warlords.\n","\n","Source: Sheridan, James E.

I was somewhat vague because I wasn't entirely certain of its properties in regard to abrasiveness.  I have read similar things regarding its negative effects on plastics and rubbers as TopAce6 stated. WD-40 is not a lubricant, and is considered by many to be very abrasive.  While it is excellent at removing grease and lubricants, on its own it is a very poor lubricant.  The rumors of WD-40 being some wonder-chemical are not as true as people would like to believe.  Do yourself a favor and make sure all WD-40 has been removed from a surface before applying a real lubricant.  Also, never use it on your bike. My only regret is that I have...boneitis.

Burgers will have the same nutritional value any way you cook them.  If you bake them or cook them in a pan, you will need an oil of some sort to keep the meat from sticking to the pan, adding fat and calories.

I know that she'd want me to make the most thoughtful and just decision possible.  Thanks again for everyone's help :) I was so disappointed in Mother Inferior because of this.  I felt like 75% had either been developed on YMH, mentioned on YMH, or completely drawn out/overdone (high and tight, stamina, other bits)  I also listen to That's Deep Bro and there was some material on there that she used in her special as well.  I hope her next one is more independent and creative of the podcasts.\n"," I feel like her stand up is kinda in between regular non-live YMH Christina and live YMH Christina. I can't even listen to the live episodes because she just loses her funny.\n","I've watched lots of videos of her old stand-up and what she does now doesn't even compare. Her older stuff was so much better. I really wish there was a more clear way to tell what or how she's feeling. I think it would make the decision  easier. She get lost in corners and behind furniture pretty often, and she's recently gotten very clumsy. She'll fall off of chairs or couches or my bed almost every day. She doesn't bark or growl at things that aren't there/people she knows. She gets very fatigued and tired very easily. I kinda joke with my mom that she's senile because she forgets where she is all the time, or she'll be following me and all of a sudden goes into a different room and then starts barking because she can't find me. She is a very happy dog most of the time, thats what makes this so hard. She doesn't seem like she's in pain or hurting, but it's easy to see she's unhealthy. That does seem very helpful, but I can't think of much she likes to do. Her favorite play time activity is literally just running around in circles with me, which she can still do. That and sleeping and cuddling. She used to chase birds/squirrels/other small animals, but not anymore. :/ That's exactly how I feel about exercising! My school schedule is such this semester that I'll be able to work out after class 3 days each week at my school's gym. I hope I'm able to stick to it.

I'm worried about the depressive side effects that are noted Thank you for your encouragement :) I've made lists of what I should do daily and weekly for self care and I'm going to use some of my Christmas money to get a pack of yoga classes. I feel like that's a good start Yes.  My ex-best friend is a lesbian and she used to tell me she was waiting for me to be gay or what to try something with a woman so that she could hook up with me.  She used to tell me I'm perfect for her, she wishes she could date someone like me, she wants to find someone like me, etc.  I had to tell her multiple times that I'm not gay or bi and that her saying those things makes me uncomfortable.  We had been best friends for years prior to these sorts of things happening, and the time period that she would say these sort of things was short lived (a few months, thank god) and it did strain our relationship.  We aren't friends anymore for other reasons, but it is a navigable situation and you just have to set boundaries and be firm.  If that doesn't work and they don't respect your boundaries or requests, then you know they are a part of the friendship for the wrong reasons. I did a psuedo juice cleanse for 70 days and lost about 20 pounds. My skin was clear, super high energy, and I slept like a baby. I also exercised for about 30 minutes a day, 6 or 7 days a week.\n","When I say psuedo juice cleanse, I mean that I would have a huge juice in the morning. Then for lunch, I would have a salad loaded with veggies and half a fruit and use hummus and lemon juice as dressing, and a huge juice for dinner. By huge I mean about 30 oz, half veggies and half fruits.  I'm a busy gal so having a 12 oz juice ever few hours wasn't an option for me, but the schedule i created for myself worked so well for me.\n","Be careful about how much fruit you're using and which kinds. I steered away from pineapple, tropical fruits, and some stone fruits because they're so high in sugar, and find some greens that won't make you gag. I HATE kale, but I love spinach and dandelion greens. So find what works for you.\n","I also drank around 100 oz of water each day and would have coffee each morning and with lunch, which isn't normal for a juice cleanse, but I love my coffee.\n","Listen to your body, if your scheduling isn't working, try moving things around.

I applied in March to the College of Community and Public Affairs, all transcripts and forms in by early April.  Still haven't gotten a response, but I called the Office of Admissions on Friday 4-28.  The girl I spoke with put me on a brief hold and then told me that they were \"trying\" to release decisions on or by May 1 (today).  Status checker still hasn't been updated.  When on the phone with her, I also asked when the transfer application deadline is and when all answers will be released by, and she said that \"there is no deadline, you can apply whenever\"\n","So long story short no one knows what's going on. I use dandelion greens in almost all of my juices, barely detectable. I use Mario badescu's buffering lotion.

Thank you :) reassurance is always nice I did my research about this because I was iffy and there was only one reputable shop in my area, so I went to European Wax Center. My friends have been to other locations and had nothing but good to say about it. I expressed my concerns to the esthetician and asked bunches of questions, but I wasn't expecting this bad of a result. I used gentle soap, frequently changed underwear and when I was going commando was even changing my skirt/sweat pants pretty frequently to cut down the risk of further infection. They're healing up though, most are already gone! I will probably never go back there just in case it was their fault, but I'll never really know Exactly what I was thinking I just got home and did a warm compress for about 15 minutes, and Lordy did it help! I didn't feel a lot of pain because of some Tylenol, but I'd say 90% of them popped or got super soft while the compress was on there and I was able to wipe the puss away. I applied Neosporin with pain reliever and it's quite red right now but looks so much better. Thank you for your help :) I honestly don't know the difference, it was a blueish color and she applied it in what I thought were really large strips and it hardened by itself. She didn't use paper strips or anything, just smeared it on super hot, waited for it to harden, pulled up a corner tab and ripped it off.  It was pretty malleable after she ripped it off too. I looked into sugaring while I was researching Brazilians and I don't know why I chose a wax over sugaring when I KNOW how bad my skin can act up. Next time maybe I don't get other areas waxed often. I have gotten my lip waxed a few times and I get a few of these pustules, but they normally go away within a day (I'm assuming because it's well ventilated) I should've expected a bad reaction because of my overall awful skin, but now I know better Thank you for this, I know anyone can say that they're a doctor over reddit but I found some hydrocortisone cream in the airport and put it on right away and the pain has definitely subsided a bit. A few have started popping by themselves. As soon as I get home I'm doing warm compress after warm compress and applying cream again. I'm a little worried because I go back to work tomorrow morning (im a server at a really busy restaurant, have to wear khakis) and I'm scared that all of the movement will cause major irritation, so I'm just praying it gets a little better over night.

One of the more subtle pieces of lore was how terrible the situation on Earth and Mars during both the warp storms and then during the Horus Heresy. I was always under the impression that years of constant war on Terra by various warlords, and the scouring of Terra by Horus completely wrecked the planet. Similar for Mars, which had regressed from terraform breathable atmosphere to a few cargo cults trapped inside their Hab-bunkers and they were actively trying to recover lost lore during the crusade. but any chance of recovery during the great crusade was completely lost due to the data virus plagues on vast stores of information and databases due to the dark mechanicus betrayal - such that if there were any existing STCs inside the vast data archives of the planet, they would invariably be corrupted by daemons or worse - so an STC fragment you might discover for a tank, might somehow only create terrible cursed tanks with machine spirits mathematically poised to kill you. That’s why Mars is so hellbent on finding STC fragments that weren’t subjected to such corruption. Ah, thanks. That makes sense since I just assumed this was public data.

Call and ask, they just did an event this past Tuesday for an organization I’m part of - a virtual meeting so we picked up food from locations around SD and then ate it while attending talks on zoom. GOAT iPhone model? iPhone 4 I’m not 100% conversant on the latest in epidemiology regarding covid. My expertise is in airborne infectious disease, but specialized in Tuberculosis transmission. The principles are the same though regarding creating a risk curve, especially with the consensus that airborne transmission is a route for covid infections. Any of the graphs we create are by their nature a measure of risk - the likelihood of becoming infected. It’s possible you have a 99% chance of infection based on your time and the total quanta inhaled of disease-laden particles, and you’re in that 1% who do not get the disease. It’s equally likely that you’re in a situation where the curve shows only a 1% chance of catching the disease and you do catch it. The principles are the same no matter what airborne disease you’re looking at, and the risk curve changes based on many different factors. I don’t think there’s a concrete risk curve generated yet, it requires more study. If you want a preprint paper on the topic specifically related to covid - I can show you this paper [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20072397v1.full.pdf). \n","\n","But it’s like cancer in the body. Every day there is one cell in your body that becomes cancerous - but your body’s immune system is amazing at killing that cell every single day. Until it doesn’t. The overall risk of cancerous cells developing and your immune system catching that cell is pretty damn great, most people won’t develop serious cancers until old age. But if your immune system slips up once, and allows a cell to proceed to divide and grow, that’s the recipe for any cancer in the body. Similarly, you don’t know what infectious particle can or can’t be caught by your immune system. It’s likely from a stats perspective that the particles you breath in from just a few seconds of exposure will be caught, or diffuse enough so you won’t develop COVID yourself. But, then again you may be unlucky, one of the 1 in 10,000 who will develop it after just a single breath. \n","\n","Sorry I can not provide detailed numbers. The point of modeling and these analyses is to extrapolate from known data points, but it’s pretty impossible to measure how many people would get sick from only a few seconds of exposure. That’s the same for TB, but we can extrapolate from what studies we do have and give you a very reasoned guess of your risk. You’re not wrong. My hands were a blur at Torrey Pines so eventually I just left my mask on, and questioned whether I should be out in the first place. But depending on the trail, my ability to put on a mask for passes is usually up to 20/hour before I start to get annoyed. \n","\n","I guess it’s to do with our threshold for mild inconveniences. I’ve been avoiding cowles for your exact reason. Airborne risk of catching a disease is measured by quanta of particles and time spent near an infectious individual. The longer time you spend in close proximity with someone who is expelling infectious particles, the higher chance you have of catching said airborne disease. \n","\n","Think about it like, if you spend 10 seconds within 6 ft of someone who is definitely sick and spewing particles, there’s a decent chance you won’t get sick. Let’s say, a 1/20 chance of getting sick yourself. But spend longer, say a half hour or 45 minutes, your chances of catching the disease increases rather aggressively, so now instead of an outside chance, it’s likely greater (say 60%+) that you will catch the disease. If you graphed that risk, any amount of exposure, any unlucky chance, will subject you to risk - so that even a minute or 30 seconds might have some possibility of infecting you - however remote. I doubt many cases arise from quick pass throughs on a trail - but I can be statistically sure that such a number is not zero, and you have a risk that starts increasing the moment you increase your time, or your interaction in a dangerous infectious area. Look up wells-Riley and work done on tuberculosis, another airborne disease to see the basis of epidemiology on this topic. \n","\n","The CDC recommends that if you spend 15 minutes within 6 feet of someone, even if noncontinuous (as in, even 5, 3 minute interactions in a 24 hour period) is sufficient to consider a close contact and a candidate for contact tracing should any member of the chain test positive or show symptoms. \n","\n","In short, any movement within a “zone of danger” exposes one to risk, and that risk becomes greater the longer you spend time there. I won’t debate whether you feel safe rolling a dice, it’s a gamble with odds that become less favorable the longer you play, but you definitely CAN catch covid from a chance interaction like on a trail. When you pass hikers either overtaking you or going the opposite direction. The trail up there is narrower than 6 feet and because of the incline, one or both parties may be breathing heavily. Besides, 6 ft is a minimum floor for distancing, even if there were 7 ft of distance in between on a trail (which is rare) when two parties pass, a mask should still be worn during the pass at least. \n","\n","It’s like 10 seconds of work repeated a few times on a trail. I just wear my mask on my wrist and pop it on whenever I pass people on the trail. If I can find an area to sit in and it’s like 10+ ft away, I sometimes just wait to the side (usually to catch my breath if I’m going up). \"I want you to render me like one of your Mars-Pattern girls.\" One timers website says that you should assume a 128/175 raw score, which equates to roughly a 1502 scaled score, so you just need a scaled 1380 on essays and pt to get to the old 1440 cutoff, and a 1278 to get to 1390. I assume they might rebalance their MBE average so your essays will require some intermediate value between 1380 and 1278 in order to show minimal competency, but who knows. If the exam follows the normal toolbox, which it had when we did the practice exam 2, then notes are available. Also it’s helpful to remember that whenever cash is involved, you have to presume that transfer of cold hard cash is also presumptive transfer of title.

I wish more people would. The last time I went into the Heights HEB was before the storm, and I saw at least 6 of those mouth breathers. I hate that I am running out of places to shop. Ugh. I'm not surprised that is the case in that area. The anti-maskers are all about \"personal freedom\" until  people start wearing burquas! I'm so sorry! What a terrible position to be in. Which store was this, may I ask? They didn't before the mandate was lifted, unfortunately. I was told by several store managers that the official policy was to offer a mask, but let the maskless wonders shop if they declined. Get out. As hard as it is to break up, you can find someone that you are truly compatible with. Future you will thank present you! Aww. Manhole was my first ever show. As a former wedding photographer, I'm sorry you are having to deal with this. The bride sounds just lovely. Texan here. I did not know this was a thing! That sounds terrible. I'm so sorry you had to go through that harrowing experience. No, but my first hint of OCD sickness was an obsession with symmetry. I imagine what you are going through is time consuming and constantly annoying:( I thought until now that they were singing \"they pockets full of gum\". How tacky of her. I am surprised that these maskholes walk around with impunity. I do speak up to them, but I wish that other people would, too. If they want to be selfish, at least make them uncomfortable.

We had to learn square dance during music class in the 4th grade (late 80's). You could ask someone to be your main partner for the big dance in the cafeteria, or be assigned one. In gym class, we learned the Cotton Eyed Joe and the Schottische. The line dances were more fun. I remember the big, mustached coach in classic 80's shorty gym shorts showing us the moves, and it's endearing now. I'm so sorry you are dealing with that! The same thing happened at Aldi near the Med Center, even though there was a security guard at the door that I assumed was placed there just for that purpose. A young couple were just browsing and enjoying their shopping while being selfish assholes. I asked the security guard about it, and he said he wasn't allowed to confront the customers. Wow! I remember those fat, cylindrical columns and the red railings. I thought the place was super fancy because it had 3 stories. A circular driveway, a 2 story house, and a pool.

However if I had to pick on something, I'd say you look at little too...friendly. Maybe extend your smile a little further than your lips, and make it less smooth, less lipstick like, and more manic.

It was raining allllll day so I melted somewhat in the rain in terms of hair and make up at the con - plus I never get decent pictures! The full length shot was taken before on a practice day, so it looked even better pre-rain, on the day xD Good job! I cosplayed Kurisu last year, but with natural hair and couldn't get the fringe quite right. I've bought a wig since, and want to try again - how'd you get yours to stick, just hair spray? Your balls sure would hurt... \"And HOW are you on reddit?!?!\" FTFY I have a crazy fear of beards. It's officially a phobia, so not sure if it's silly (pogonophobia). I don't really know why, but there's a photo of me as a toddler looking fucking terrified of some guy dressed as Santa.. Who knows? My house mate has this, even thinking about the texture and feel of it makes her feel sick. Looks good! I'll see you there perhaps - cosplaying as Meg from Hercules! :D Watch out for frying pans.. Why a wig? And the title says WIP for a reason - it's no where near finished.  Thanks! :D Yeah...I need to invest in a brow pencil haha.  I've still a lot of work to do on the dress, but I'll be uploading pictures of that too when its all sewn, and then of the completed cosplay on the day! :D Thanks! That's really helpful. I did wonder about pushing for a higher pony, but this was my first try of hair and make up, so I'll be making a few adjustments. You can buy those weird bump up grips, so maybe i'll try that... Thanks for the tips/link! Blow drying it while pulling it straight with a brush or comb (it'll get super hot, so doing it just with your fingers you might burn yourself). As cowsflyhigh44 says make sure you do this until it's fully dry, and dry it on a hot heat, and pull it in the direction it'll be styled. Then straighten it with straighteners/flat irons, keep doing this IN THE DIRECTION OF STYLING. Else you'll end up with kinks and fly away bits when you come to style it. Before starting to actually style the hair, I would always hairspray an old hair brush then quickly brush the hairspray into the hair, to help hold the straightness. Alternately you can apply mousse to all your hair before drying but that might make your hair more \"crispy\" before you style it. Then style and shape with gel and mousse as appropriate :) \n","\n","TL;DR, blow dry, straighten, brush through hairspray, gel & style.

We've got Early Entry tickets, would previous attendees recommend still getting there before 9:30? I'm cosplaying Kurisu this summer, and have just bought my own Lab Coat - I found the same problem, but for the length I think unless you make it yourself you'll just have to settle. I'd go with the Dickies one as, something that came up in my search is that the collar part has to be long too. Also the pockets will be wrong on pretty much every lab coat you find. I've removed the pockets from mine, and am planning to re-attach them where the openings are for reaching your normal clothes underneath. The Steins;Gate Lab coats are very stylized, It's difficult!

However it may cost you another satoshi in transaction fee.\n","\n","Bitcoin wasn't really intended to do micro-transactions. Bitcoin could be better thought of as a \"closing house\" for settling off chain transactions. A service such as ChangeTip will handle the micro-transaction, and when you withdraw the money into a bitcoin wallet, you are settling a month's worth or so of micro-transactions in one big lump. Good idea! And that's why it'll never be implemented. The sad thing is, lots of people are eating up this propaganda and believing what you stated to be the truth. So much easier to blame a plant than to blame the systemic war machine. And she still listens to Ace of Base. You are needlessly pedantic and lack a sense of humor.

That's a blatant straw man argument.\n","\n","I'm beginning to think your only purpose in this subreddit is to waste people's time with nonsensical and irrelevant arguments. You are a troll.

You don't care much for bitcoin and this community and you always like to come here and make it known. Well shouldn't it be obvious what this means? It means fiat is flowing into the bitcoin market through Coinbase first. Also I'm sure Coinbase's no fee trading promotion has something to do with it. I'd also guess more Americans trust using a domestic exchange rather than an offshore one.\n","\n","Once the Coinbase exchange is more accessible and offers margin trading, I see no reason why they won't be the market leader in bitcoin trading (unless the WInklevii beat Coinbase to the punch and Gemini turns out to be a really killer product out of the gate). this is the correct answer. \n","1913 You are gorgeous 😍 100% YESSSS 😍😍😍😍 Omg you look amazing 😍😍😍😍 Would love to hang out!

It's 700 billion\n","\n","They continued to argue until someone finally said about 7 billion. \n","1933 Robert Hazen, in his book Genesis, dedicates several pages to the idea that the original building blocks of life were transferred to Earth from Mars. The reason this theory has credibility is that the core building blocks of life, the sugars and bases associated with RNA and DNA, are very fragile. This gets around the problem of the presence of oxygen in the early earth which is destructive to the early proto-biotics. Sorry, but in the larger scheme, abiogenesis is part of the equation. Life's origins are as important as the structure that permits the procreation of life.\n","\n","\"Genetics isn't simply a programming language, and even if it were, tracing and debugging the massive amount of information is extremely difficult,\"\n","\n","The more complexity that is presented, the more difficult it is to resolve the matter. Programming languages have structure just as DNA does. We have made great strides in understanding the genetic code in reference to the transcription of proteins from the base DNA information, but the development of an enzyme or a hormone does not define the larger context. I find it amazing that most evolutionists simply gloss over the need for a control system. It is the same a computer without an operating system which effectively makes it a boat anchor. The idea that the 17 or so trillion cells in our bodies are not managed or controlled by such a program through embryotic developement is a real stretch. Where is the operating system for the human body? Are you suggesting that all of the chemical processes necessary for life are the result of stimuli from other parts of the body? That is a circular argument.\n","\n","Response to stimuli does not account for instinct. One of my favorite examples of instinct is the cuckoo bird. There are species of cuckoo birds that do not build nests but simply lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. The cuckoo egg is ‘programmed’ to hatch before the eggs of the host nest and the young cuckoo chick pushes the other eggs out of the nest. Having removed the competition, the young cuckoo bird now is nurtured by the host. How did the behavior of this hatchling get transferred to the next generation? It's mother is long gone, the 'trait' as you call it needs to make its way in some form to the child. Are you saying it is embedded in the gene pool? Where? As I indicated earlier, there is quite a gap between transcribing proteins and constructing complex behaviors where no nurture is identified. \n","\n","My point is that natural selection as espoused by Darwinists requires as much faith as the belief in God. Pick your poison... The gaps in the fossil record, chemical evolution and other facets of the theory of evolution as it touches on the origin and progression of life, such as control systems and instinct, are as challenging as the idea that supernatural phenomenon accounts for what is called life on earth  Your definition of 'intelligent design' is very narrow. If you read some of the writings around intelligent design, you will find that the focus is much broader. One of the key elements of Meyer's book, Signature in the Cell, is that information isn't the product of random chemical activity. There are certainly supporting arguments in the fossil record that support the theory of evolution. There are also elements, such as the Cambrian explosion, that don't fit well with the Darwinian model. \n","\n","Most major evolutionists, such as Neil Shubin (author of the Inner Fish), acknowledge that neo-Darwinian evolution assumes the existence of DNA. One of the challenges to the theory of evolution is, in my opinion, the lack of a clear path from the chemical soup to DNA. The origin of life is still an unknown.\n","\n","If neo-Darwinian evolution is true, then all information needed to build a sentient living being is contained in the DNA of a cell. While the vast majority of DNA has been found to transcribe and moderate the proteins needed for life, no information has been found that defines the body structure nor the development of the being. Where is the template for the development of the embryo? Where is the operating system that regulates all of the organs and functions of the body? Where does instinct come from? There are many unanswered questions as to the information needed to produce life from non-life and to instill in that life the necessary control systems to support life. As I see it, intelligent design is asking some pretty credible questions. \n","1934 I am a fan of clear shades  Congrats man, its tough to try and beat a 1000 rated player playing am's lol, I'm gonna try next year up here in Minneapolis.

I dont know about mid panic attack, but for general random anxieties, L-theanine is pretty good. \"The Stress Formula\" has l-theanine and a calming blend of lavendar chamomile and lemon extract. I stopped taking that because chamomile can interact with oral contraceptives.\n","\n","Also, heard great reviews about standardized chamomile, but didn't try it.  ive had recent success with l-theanine. even if its placebo, seems good to me. its what they put in calming formulas for pets, and its the main calming ingredient in tea.  on the same note as this, I read on this subreddit about naming your 5 senses. \"ok, I see me living room, the tv is on the light is on. I smell the couch and my fabric softener. I hear the tv.. etc etc\" taking time to list all that out can shift focus shout out for headspace! quick 10 minute breathing exercises that can mellow you out a tad big shout out to my homie l-theanine making me feel anxiety-free (severely decreased) for the past week! look into it!\n","\n"," Yeah, it sucks, it's like, \"this could happen again at any minute oh god\" then that puts me on edge too. i feel ya I don't know what your idea of \"natural\" or \"medication\" is, but this is kind of both?\n","\n"," I too was thinking your thoughts a few days ago and came across an article that suggested l-theanine. I went to CVS and bought some (even buy one get one free, sweet!) So far so good. I take two when I wake up and notice a difference within an hour or less. Lasts a while too. But it's only been two days, but I love it so far. It's called L-Theanine Stress Formula with Calming Blend. \n","\n","Even if it is a placebo, its a great placebo. \n","\n","\n","Also, the article reccomended standardized chamomile extract, but I haven't picked that up yet, as I am impressed with the L-Theanine alone. SO impressed, I almost wanted to make my own post earlier to shout it from the roof tops, but it has aleady been done here before I think.\n","\n","\n","edit: [here's the article](http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20669377_2,00.html)\n","\n","[and another probably more reputable](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296328) It totally sounds like how I was feeling with my anxiety. I was almost more anxious about the thought of being anxious than the situation itself!\n","\n","Anyways, on this sub someone mentioned they felt like me and had anticipatory anxiety. I never knew that was an actual thing, so googled it and stuff and it made me feel good to know it exists!\n","\n","I came across [this](http://www.drmartinseif.com/resources/anticipitory-anxiety.html) and found it to be pretty helpful. He really explains it in a way that made me totally understand it. Here's a quick bit from the page I linked above.\n","\n","> First, label your anticipatory anxiety as just that--anticipatory anxiety.  It is real anxiety, but it is different from the anxiety you will experience when you make contact with what frightens you. Remind yourself that anticipatory anxiety has a life of its own, and can remain a potent source of fear even after you have otherwise conquered your phobia.\n","\n","\n","> Second, remember that anticipatory anxiety is not an accurate indicator of how anxious you will be when you encounter your anxiety triggers.  Stay with the fact that 95% of the time your anticipatory anxiety will be much greater than the anxiety you experience when you are in the situation. As you practice exposing yourself to your fears, you will see that a pattern begins to emerge:  anticipatory anxiety will generally be much higher than your situational anxiety.  Make note of this patterns as they emerge, and try to use these facts to anchor yourself.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Whenever I feel that anticipation creeping up I flashback to reading that article and take a few deep breaths to let that set in for a second ahha. \n","\n","I hope this is the same way you were feeling, and that this can alleviate some of the bad feelings.\n"," What frightens you about needles? The pain? The potential risk of contamination? The results afterwards?  Originally prescribed ativan for occasional anxiety. This grew to almost daily anxiety with bigger attacks here and there. \n","\n","I dont like to take the ativan a lot (fear of becoming dependant/bad withdrawls/overall bad rap) so I only take it in emergencies and suck it up for my daily anxiety. \n","\n","UNTIL, I read online about L-Theonine. I don't want to jinx myself, because I am only two days into taking it, but my anxiety has significantly decreased. I don't care if it is a placebo, if it works, it works. I feel almost immediately (<30min) calmer and it lasts quite some time. \n","\n","I know this will vary person to person, but look into it if you're interested! commenting to come back to video later thanks for the breakdown! i've never heard of the 4/20 schedule before, super interesting! oh wow i see thanks for explaining chill off neck? > It also clued me in that many of the things I was using to cope were possibly making things worse in the long run.\n","\n","\n","I know you just said giving advice was overwhelming BUT, may I ask what the coping mechs were that were making things worse ?

Going vegetarian or vegan can also be considered an ED behavior to therapists and doctors because of cutting out foods. Which can be true in some cases, like going vegan in the middle of your ED but I don't think it should be looked as an ED behavior if you've been vegetarian or vegan for years before that.\n","\n","Many people who suffer from eating disorders have fear foods they won't touch. Such as potato chips, chocolate or peanut butter. Which is why doctors don't allow any food restrictions.

Kids have it so easy these days. I graduated with a masters in aerospace engineering in May 2010 and found myself in a very similar situation. Albeit, finding a job at that point in time was more difficult than what I understand the situation is today.\n","\n","I ended up taking an \"internship\" / trial position @ $15/hr for the first few months after graduation, and continued to apply elsewhere. Ended up landing a full-time position in August of that year, and do not regret the time spent there in the interim. Just do not plan to stick around for too long, and do not stop applying for other positions. Just to add a data point for you. My first job out of college (STEM field) was for 55k at a contract house as well (minimal benefits). After \\~10 months on the job, I received a full-time offer from the company, and asked for 72k and was given it no questions asked, which means I'm sure I left opportunity on the table. This was alongside a very large increase in benifits (no 401k match to 8%, 1 week vacation to 2 + 2 weeks of holidays, etc.) I have paid anywhere from the minimums on the loans (~$1100) to up towards $1800 per month depending on what else was going on in my life during that time period. I currently have my auto-pay set to $1475.\n","\n","The biggest enabler has been living with 2 roommates for this entire time period, which has helped keep my monthly costs low. I also have received raises & promotions since graduation which has helped on the income side. I haven't lived the most frugal life style and could likely have paid them off already if I was so inclined, but I'm content with the rate they are being paid and OK with the ~3k in interest i will accumulate between now and payoff (assuming no setbacks). Just to provide you another data point, I graduated in 2010 with $116k of student loan debt and a starting salary of $55k. I sit here roughly 7 years after graduation and have managed to get the debt down to $44k, on-pace to have it paid off in 10 years. It may seem impossible now but keep paying the most you can each month, it gets easier over time.\n","\n","\n","Keep your expenses manageable and follow every opportunity you have to expand your income, there really isn't much of a trick to it beyond those two items. I was able to refinance from ~6.5% down to 5% after a couple of years of payments, and if you keep yours up I imagine the same will apply for you.\n","\n","Good luck! I have a fairly straight forward tax return (1 W2, one state, no 1099 income of any sort) so I figured I'd give Credit Karma a try this year. I ended up having some initial issues inputting my HSA information correctly, but after running the numbers with Turbo Tax to see what it \"should be\", I was able to get the two to line up and save myself the ~80 bucks or whatnot that Turbo Tax would have charged (state filing fee and HSA forms require an upgrade.) Just as a data point for you, I refinanced about $55k in private student loans with Earnest in March of last year. I received a 4.98% rate for a 10 year term, down from a ~5.9% variable rate at my previous lender. My credit score was a bit higher than yours at the time (~750), and i had the option to lower the rate closer to ~4% if I decreased the length of the term. You have less debt and a higher income than I did when I graduated in 2010 (114k debt @ ~6%, 55k salary). By making higher payments and obtaining several raises over the last 6 years I am on pace to have my loans paid off in 3 years, and I'm very glad I won't have another 16 years of payments floating over my head beyond that. Just one man's opinion.  I'd suggest using a site such as Credit Karma to get a quick & rough idea of where your credit score actually is. 7.25% fixed does seem high to me, so perhaps your credit isn't as good as you think it is.\n","\n","For a point of reference, about 4 months ago I refinanced my loans (55k) with Earnest and was able to secure financing at 4.98% fixed for a ~9.5 year repayment. This is with a ~800 FICO score.\n","\n","Either way, the rate is lower than your currently paying, and I don't believe SoFi has any fees for refinancing, so there isn't a good reason not to take the offer.  As a data point for you, I just refinanced about 56k of private student loan debt with Earnest and obtained a 4.98% fixed rate for a ~9 year repayment term. There were lower APR options available for selecting a variable rate or shorter repayment term (on a sliding scale). This is with a 800+ FICO score.  Just as a point of reference for you, I recently refinanced my student loans with Earnest. I have a very high credit score (over 800 FICO on whatever bureau is reporting to Chase Slate) and was only able to secure a 4.98% fixed rate for my ~55k of private loans. There was an option to get a slightly lower rate (but not lower than 4%) if I were to shorten the term of the loan, but I wanted to keep some flexibility in my minimum payment. \n","\n","If you are seeing a rate advertised much lower than that, I would assume it's variable or for a very short repayment period.  \n","1946 no worries, i understood! sorry! sex is not all i'm interested in. i know that i'll never have a relationship with catriona. but with megan it is possible. i just don't want to pass up a night with catriona if there's no chance of anything further happening with megan. eighteen EDIT: i am a girl. \n","1947 Well since I continue to pull these mon and see no use for them I nominate Fria and Anteras both of which I have pulled awakened and twice non awakened \n","1948 If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it.

Equip any heavy gauntlet u have, it gives solid +80 to your Attack Rating (quickiest to get one might be \"Stone gauntlets\", found in a chest right past the Hydra, inside the cave that leads to DLC), it's nice boost. Also \"Allfather's ring\" (found in a narrow ledge in the Tomb of the Giants) boost AR 50. Also if you want to get free lightning weapon fast: Rush to Nito's domain, in the area before actual boss fight. There is one little cave there containing a \"Voltaic spear\". If you happen to have few Chunks, its a quite boost already.  What place is referred as \"Reflecting pool\"? Sorry i don't recall. Best way for me was when u got to the first rafter, start running towards the wall corner, then just adjusting the camera angle make your character run the ledge and jump to the next rafters corner, that way you wont over jump it, and wont roll over it. Thanks man! Which gauntlets are the best to have for min/max equipload and power? And not to mention that those gargoyles will give u the new \"Bonerust\" debuff (slower stamina gain and less efficient estus recovery), if u take few hits from them. U will know when u get it by havin \"Evil Eye\" looking mark in your buffs. Wow thats actually cool! Never thought it like that. In anycase, if someone is wondering what do u get when killing these: >!3x Titanite chunk \\*placeholderplaceholder\\*!< Inside the chest, furthest place in the tar pit. Titanite demon is guarding it. Listen carefully near the bonfire, does that sound familiar? Im with u in this! I love it too, its harder and thats what make it so good.

My guess is that you are not training and just playing the game. Hard to guess without watching your gameplay but honestly the key to getting out of diamond is being fast and consistent. Solid rotations and passing is important but will be more key in champ and gc than in diamond. I politely disagree with your conclusion. The end result was that the company got increased productivity, even if people were hiding their true productive capabilities. They designed a clear reward system for achieving targets which motivated employees to step up their work. Yes, it cost the company money and it took some time to get there but if it’s a well run company the benefits will cover these costs. \n","\n","Lots of people in this thread complain that there is no reward system for their increase in productivity at their workplace. Sounds like your company has good management, at least, based off your example. Not everyone has to be as boring as you. You will use it when you inevitably buy more Apple products in the future. Stop whining. It will long term. For example, I have like 5 wall adapters and 5 lightning cables that I don’t use because of buying Apple products throughout the years. \n","\n","In 3-5 years people will have less wall adapters, cables, etc. The carbon footprint will be reduced. Gotta start somewhere. Economic policies aren’t inherently good or bad. They have trade offs and it’s up to the policy makers to determine whether they can live with these trade offs or not. \n","\n","Moral hazard is one of these trade offs. I am well aware that moral hazard presents challenges but as long as there are well functioning regulatory agencies and judicial system, moral hazard can be mitigated. Note that I am not claiming the US’ are perfect, but they’re far better compared to other countries. For example, compare the true costs of bank bailouts in the US vs the true costs of bank bailouts in countries such as Indonesia in 1997 or Argentina 1980. \n","\n","Yes, moral hazard is one of the main issues that comes from bank bailouts. The term “too big to fail” also incentivizes other financial intermediaries (that are not banks) to behave recklessly (see AIG in 2008). However, if you had been the chair at the Fed in 2008 and faced a credit crunch that would send the US economy back to the stone age, I am sure you’d think a bank bailout would be a no brainer. Finally someone with a brain. Also, people don’t understand the banking system so they think those bailouts were not necessary which is simply not true. Do they really run on a platform of racism? I think that is a simplistic way of viewing the world. \n","\n","Trump thrives on the idea of destroying the status quo. His supporters love the idea of a man that can completely change the American political system, destroying all this two-party bullshit that doesn’t allow real change to happen. Many Americans are tired of the same old Democrat vs Republican bullshit system and want real change. They want a stop to weak immigration policy, they want jobs, they want capitalism, they want moral values, and they see Trump as the only viable candidate to bring about such change. \n","\n","It’s easy to dismiss people who think differently as racists, uneducated, wrong; but don’t let the media and social networks cloud your judgement. Once you understand what Trump stands for is really hard to call Trump supporters idiots. You have to be blind if you don’t see all these problems in America. People are fed up with the system and will do anything, including bringing a figure like Trump, to change things. \n","\n","Again, I don’t support Trump. But I have made sure to listen to both sides and ignore the bullshit inbetween. Perhaps more people should do this too. The pre-covid economy was arguably slowing down. I am not saying Trump did a horrible job with the economy but people tend to overestimate how good the economy was doing. Check interest rates before Covid. \n","\n","It is also worth noting that economies tend to do better under a Democrat government. So a Biden presidency might not be as bad as you think. \n","\n","And by the way, I am a conservative. You are preaching identity politics whether you want to accept it or not. You have no proof of whether Trump is biased against latinos or not except from news reports from Leftist media outlets. \n","\n","“They hate us because of our race! Let’s unite against them!”. Explain how that isn’t identity politics. \n","\n","I don’t necessarily support Trump. I do however strongly oppose people saying I should vote/not vote for someone simply because of my ethnicity. As if being Latino defines my whole character. Fuck outta here. Fuck your identity politics. Meh, I don’t remember my first time any more than any other time. I barely think about it. Every time I quit I have NO energy whatsoever. Some people claim they feel so much energy after quitting but for me it’s always the opposite. The only cure for it that I’ve seen is time and exercise. Working out wakes me up instantly. \n","\n","I think the most important thing is to adopt a mindset where you accept that vaping has messed up with your brain and endure through the annoying symptoms of quitting. Accept the fact that there is no magical cure for being sleepy all the time and lacking motivation. These are just the side effects of having toxic addictions. The only “normal” we’ll ever see if when we drop these addictions for good. \n","\n","Also, now that I think of it, when I vaped I also lacked motivation to do anything. So perhaps it was an underlying depression that was causing it all. Who knows. Bruh... I’ll bet you $10 right now that at the very least 8 out of 10 people that read your profile don’t know about that “lifestyle”.\n","\n","You might be really into that lifestyle, but in the grand scheme of things most people don’t know about it/care enough to read about it. \n","\n","I wouldn’t expect people to know about some obscure cult/religion/culture/lifestyle if I was part of one, and calling them uneducated just because of it is wrong. As the other commenter said, to 80% of the people*, child-free means you don’t have kids.\n","\n","And trust me, I would never date someone with a kid so I understand your frustration \n","\n","* = at the very least Learning how to write properly boosts your analytical abilities.

There was a girl I had fallen in \"love\" with (whatever, I thought love was at the time) from the 7th grade. But before I tell you what I did that was so stupid, I must lay down some contextual layers\n","\n","This stupid act of mine was only possible because I was one of the young and ignorant kids fortunate enough to grow up with internet sites like MySpace. MySpace enabled me to grow an absolutely unnatural relationship with this girl through the grace of modern technology. After meeting her at school, I added her to my friends list and eventually acquired her phone number. I never called, I only communicated by text. This is important because this was my *first* crush.\n","\n"," I originally met her in class, but instead of hanging out, talking and building a relationship like regular human being, I was only connected to her by the text from which we exchanged. And text there was, I texted her all day long. I grew feelings for this girl over time because we knew so much about each other, but it felt weird when we were actually in person to talk. I felt, and had reasons to believe, she had similar feelings.\n","\n","This eventually evolved into me buying her a fucking gift basket full of shit I though she might have wanted for her birthday. I spent like 70$ of my money I had saved up and almost spent more on a necklace. This exchange was so fucking awkward that it gives me diarrhea just thinking about it now, but at the time it felt as if it would bring us closer. It did not, she got banged by some upperclassman and I developed my hatred of \"cheaters\" and other similar types of dishonestly. I became more altruistic\n","Because I didn't want to do the same to anyone else, but the \"relationship\" and how it existed had a significant impact on my development as a social creature. All and all I'm not that autistic.\n","\n","Tl;dr I bought a giftbag full of stuff for a girl I hardly knew. \n","1962 t0p kek \n","1963 Because both tracks are features?

Ok, from a bit of experimentation, I can confirm that despite being a spell you cast yourself, trigger-cast curses do NOT count as self-cast and cannot gain Doom. The butterfly effect is basically another name for chaos theory, but entropy is something else. The confusion comes because people often describe entropy to laypeople as \"chaos\" or \"freedom\", but that's not really true in any way that's intuitive to laypeople. A better explanation for someone who doesn't want to acually learn theromdynamics is that entropy is the tendency for energy to spread out over the available degrees of freedom. For example, that's why if part of something is hotter than another part, heat will flow until they're the same temperature. On a macro scale, entropy often tends to make things less chaotic, because things will tend towards simple states of thermal equilibrium which can often be predicted just by knowing the total energy available. Also, for complicated reasons related to quantum mechanics, entropy only really makes sense in non-deterministic systems. Chaos theory is more about how small changes can unpredictably affect large systems, even if those systems are deterministic and don't feature any true randomness. Entropy and chaos theory are sort of similar, but they're not interchangeable. Entropy works on a micro scale, and it's more about how different conditions tend towards the same end state, while chaos theory is on the macro scale and focuses on the way that slight differences between two systems can lead to dramatic divergences. Chaos theory relates to the idea of how very small differences can have huge effects over time. It's a big part of why a lot of systems are really hard to model on a computer, because even if you start out with a very accurate model, the slightest imperfections can cause it to diverge from reality. Cooking doesn't actually add nutrients to food, but it does make it easier to digest, allowing us to both spend less energy and recover more of the total nutrients when we do digest the food. Because we usually eat cooked food, humans can also skimp on digestive tract relative to most omnivores and still get enough nutrients out of our food to survive. To be a bit more specific, curves spread a radar pulse out in all directions, while sharp angles reflect in a few specific directions, making it less likely that the original signal will hit the detector. That's why stealth aircraft usually have weird sharp angles everywhere while civilian aircraft (which care more about fuel efficiency and generally *want* to be detectable) usually have rounded designs. One of two options: Usually the computer doesn't completely power down and keeps a clock running even when it's supposedly off, using a tiny battery. Alternatively, it can just connect to the internet on startup and check a time server to update the clock when it does so. Most devices just keep a battery that can run the clock for a while without getting plugged in though, since otherwise it might get really confused if it can't find internet. There are two good answers depending on whether you care more about the short-medium term or the long term.\n","\n","In the short term, the answer is that learning about space provides useful scientific insights which can translate into technology. For example, GPS and satellite phones wouldn't be possible without space travel, nor would the really good pictures we have the Earth's surface. Looking a bit into the future, it's possible that asteroid mining will one day allow us to get rare metals for way cheaper than they cost now, and do it without seriously harming the environment. \n","\n","The much longer-term answer is that if we want to survive, it's probably going to become necessary for us to expand beyond the nice starter planet we evolved on. We've already done a startling amount of damage to our ecosystem, and despite all the green movements in the world that damage is still getting worse. With a bit more technological progress we can escape Earth and at least semi-terraform other planets so that even in a worst-case disaster that renders Earth truly ininhabitable we could still survive as a species. The big thing to remember is that humans weren't made by a purposeful creator, they were kludged together by a random process that can be counted on to get rid of anything suicidal on a bloodline level but not much more. As long as a gene doesn't reliably code for non-reproductive behavior in every individual, it can get away with modifying the sex drive for primarily social purposes or even removing it entirely.\n","\n","One kind of interesting hypothesis I've heard is that the reason homosexuality is so common in humans is that it's actually a survival trait on the family level, because if you're a straight parent you can tap your gay siblings and their partners for help with child-rearing. Partly, closing your eyes lets you reduce the amount of signals your brain has to process while it's supposed to be resting, partly it keeps your eyes safe and moist. It's a little bit like putting a dvd in a case when you aren't using it, prevents random damage from building up over time. The internet isn't magically indestructible, though it would be insanely hard for any one event to take it down by breaking servers. The reason why it seems that way is because information is generally stored in multiple places and the internet is designed to be robust, meaning that if something is unavailable it can look for a backup with the same information. There are somewhere on the order of 100 million physical servers on Earth, and any given piece of information might be stored on anywhere from two or three to dozens or more different servers depending on how important it is and how many people need access. And generally, the more important something will be the more backups they'll make and the more different physical places they'll store those backups. If any one server building stopped responding, such as if the building burned down or someone came through and smashed everything with a crowbar, the other servers would automatically coordinate to get everyone their information from another server with the same data on it, and at worst users would get slightly worse ping times. But if a large fraction of the world's servers all went down at the same time, it could become impossible to find some data at all because every place it was stored in was lost. If it got even worse than that, the systems which are designed to coordinate between all of those many servers could be overwhelmed and the entire internet could truly shut down.\n","\n","You probably shouldn't worry too much about that, because anything which could take out enough servers all across the world to even seriously slow down the internet would be pretty apocalyptic, and if such a thing happened internet outages would be the least of our worries. In general, a computer bug comes from something interacting with something else in a way the programmer didn't expect. Running a piece of software on the same hardware removes a few of those bits of strangeness, but there are a lot which still depend on really specific things, so unless you're doing the exact same things in the software, you might not get the same results. For example, in a game one of you might get an item which has some kind of rendering bug, which means that something weird might happen whenever he's on screen but not otherwise, even if you're running the same game on the same kind of machine. For most math problems which we don't have an agreed-upon solution to, we usually either have competing hypotheses about the answer, or we have kludgy specific solutions which don't lend deep insight but let the engineers do their jobs anyways. If we have competing hypotheses, what they'll reveal isn't actually the solution, so much as a step-by-step explanation of how they got from what we already know to the answer we weren't sure about. If we already had solutions for specific cases, we can not only use the step-by-step approach but also check whether the new solution matches the general cases. Often we can also check the math against reality. For example, if you found a general solution to the Schroedinger equation (You don't need to know what that is, just that it's important to quantum mechanics), it would give certain predictions about how a particle would behave under different conditions. If the math and physics communities couldn't find any clear flaws in that solution, they could construct an experiment to see whether a particle actually behaves the way that the solution says it should. When a light-detecting cell in your eye gets triggered, it needs a few moments to reset before it's ready to send another signal. To keep this from being a problem all the time, your pupil will get larger in the dark and smaller in the light to control the amount getting to those cells and keep them from all triggering at once and being locked down together. However, if you get hit with a light which is suddenly way brighter than you were used to, such as if someone turns on a light in a dark room, your pupil can't respond fast enough and the cells get saturated anyways. When that happens, it takes some time for the cells to be ready to detect light again.\n","\n","This is unpleasant and disorienting, but ultimately harmless. However, if you do something like staring at the sun for a prolonged period, you can actually cause permanent damage as you basically give those light-detecting cells a sunburn. It's ok to get dazzled by bright lights now and then, but please don't stare at the sun. Hey, are you that guy from Youtube who got called out because Computerphile's comment-generator bot learned to reply to you? A couple of people seem to have the biochemistry side covered, so I'll give an explanation for my guess about why these reactions evolved. Generally, any situation which makes you angry is probably at least somewhat dangerous, because you usually get angry when you've been either provoked (meaning you might need to fight for something) or attacked (meaning you're already in a fight). In a dangerous situation, it's important to not be distracted or impaired, so your body will suppress pain and burn additional resources to let you function despite exhaustion or hunger. Unfortunately, because we don't like to feel tired, hungry, or sore, we tend to abuse that reaction and get a little bit angry to suppress those feelings even when there's nothing else to be angry about. Theres a thing in psychology called the four stages of competence, which go like this:\n","\n","1. Unconcious incompetence: You're just flailing around, and don't really understand enough to know why you're struggling.\n","2. Conscious incompetence: You're still not very good, but you're starting to understand where your deficiencies are and how to make real progress improving.\n","3. Conscious competence: You've learned everything you need to know to do really well, but you still need to focus to do it.\n","4. Unconscious competence: The skills have become reflexive, to the point that all you need to do is identify the task and your body will just go to work without the conscious part of your mind needing to get involved closely.\n","\n","The problem is that during high-stress situations like an exam or a performance, it can be hard to relax and let your subconscious get to work. It's almost like having a subordinate you can just tell to do something for your. This is a problem, because once you reach unconscious competence you can get out of practice at actually thinking through the process, which means if you do start consciously thinking about it you won't be able to do as well as your subconscious.\n","\n","If you want a way to see this without the stress of choking on a test, try walking across a room, but pay attention to every individual movement that your feet, legs, and toes have to do. You'll find that you're slower, clumsier, and have worse balance until you stop paying attention and just let yourself go back to walking normally. This is because walking is about as deep into unconscious competence as you can get, to the point that almost nobody more than a few years old thinks about it at all. This doesn't really have a good answer which is both satisfying and simple, because figuring out stuff like that is one of the things very smart people spend a decade or more in med school learning. The best simple answer is that once they know what's going on with a patient, they consider how long patients in a similar state of health tended to last.\n","\n","That said, if the patient acts in an unusual way or just has unusually good or bad luck, those predictions can turn out wrong. I've known two different people who lived for several years on \"six months to live\". To a chemist, \"alcohol\" refers to a specific chemical structure, an oxygen bonded to a hydrogen (also called a hydroxyl group), which is found in many different chemicals. \"drinking alcohol\" is ethanol, two carbons bonded to 5 hydrogens and an hydroxyl group. \"rubbing alcohol\" is isopropyl alcohol, which is 3 carbons bonded to seven hydrogens with a hydroxyl group coming off the middle carbon.\n","\n","There's also denatured alcohol, which is alcohol intended for industrial purposes, which has something nasty or toxic added so people don't drink it to get drunk. As an interesting but disturbing sidenote, the phrase \"blind drunk\" comes from the fact that during prohibition, several people went permanently blind because of drinking denatured spirits with methanol. Human brains aren't like computers, which can quickly write a huge amount of information to disk space and be ready for more. When a human brain is introduced to new information, especially new information which either comes in large volumes at once or which recontextualizes a lot of other information, we spend a lot of time filing that information away, updating the connections to the other information in our brains, and thinking about whether other information in our brains needs to be corrected or thrown out because the new information casts doubt on it. In the long run, this is good for us because that need to work new information into a larger conceptual framework is how we can understand the world and do fancy stuff like make predictions and set goals, but it also means that our brains need to work a lot harder than a computer that just stores isolated programs and runs them on demand. And the human brain is an organ, and a hungry organ at that. It generally takes around 10-15% of a person's calorie needs despite being only about 2-3% of their body mass. When you force it to run full power for hours on end digesting huge amounts of very dense information, you're going to end up tired and hungry.\n","\n","TL;DR: your brain requires a lot of energy because it needs to process the new information and relate it to everything else you know. Basically, humans aren't adapted to have enough food easily available. We evolved needing to aggressively seek out food to keep ourselves from starving. More specifically, we evolved with the constant risk that even if we had plenty of food now we might need to go a few lean months before we got any more. One result is that even though we're consciously aware that we don't need more than a certain amount of food (especially with our comparatively sedentary lifestyles) we can't easily overrule the instinct to keep cramming in as much food as our bodies can process in case the antelopes migrate and we don't get any more food for two weeks. My guess would be that because Reddit's system for liking or disliking content makes it less visible to everyone, where Facebook's just hides it from you. I don't know the exact numbers, but let's assume that most people don't want to see conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, etc. If those people go on Facebook and block every bit of content that bothers them, they won't see it but it'll still be there. If they go on Reddit and downvote the same kinds of content, every post that the majority of people dislike will vanish from view in a hail of downvotes, meaning that nobody will see it except the handful of people who saw it before it got into the negative ratings and helped shoot it down. And this snowballs, because Redditors who post antivax stuff and get downvoted out of view with no responses except a few personal insults and some attempts to convert them away from antivax ideology are liable to get discouraged and either shut up or migrate. Conversely, Facebookers who post antivax content might get a few hostile responses, but because most people just insta-block they're much more likely to get rewarded with likes and praise from fellow anti-vaxxers, which will encourage them to post more.\n","\n","The one exception is whatever subreddits are controlled BY antivaxxers. Those places might get the occasional flame war, but for the most part they'll have a sense of consensus that vaccines are evil, because in those subreddits pro-vaxxers are the outnumbered ones who get shouted down if they argue. Even if they don't get discouraged by the negative response, eventually they're liable to get kicked by the mods anyway.\n","\n","TLDR: Reddit's algorithm is less friendly to echo chambers for unpopular opinions. The big problem is the hingepins when you slash with it. Every time you hit something with a swing, the torque puts a shear strain on both hingepins equal to the force exerted by the blade times the ratio of blade length to the distance between the pins, which looks to be around 20. You would probably be ok using it as a stabbing weapon, right up until you stick it in a monster and the monster twists.\n","\n","Also, the required mobility would mean that the piece could never be as rigid as a solid spear, which means that the play would be robbing every strike of power even if the weapon didn't actually break. I was actually going to comment with basically the exact same pair of criticisms. On the bright side, at least there's a sensible reason for doing it, even if it's not compelling enough to actually justify the expense and problems. \n","1969 Along with all other resources,I would also like to recommend Nova math bible.\n","\n","The language of questions is quite similar to what is in the gre exam.

As a love of premium coffee, and a frequenter of Stauf's, I have to admit that I am none too impressed with their coffee.  If I go there, it is because the coffeehouse environment is great for meeting up with people, studying, staring off, etc.\n","\n","The best local beans, as mentioned here, are from One Line, Brioso, and Impero. I may be mistaken but One Line usually has the better price per bag, and is consistently my favorite.  Another mention is Mission Coffee (also Short North area), they carry beans from quality roasters outside of Columbus.\n","\n","Another gripe I have with Stauf's is brewing method.  Any of the aforementioned roasters will give you pour-over coffee by default and they brew it wonderfully (especially One Line). When I ask for pour-over at Stauf's I'm not too impressed with the result. I attribute this more to the brewing rather than the beans.\n","\n","Last point to make: buying whole beans at Stauf's involves them from a giant stock of beans, which makes me wonder how much turnover and how fresh they really are. If you want the full-force tasting experience, find a good small-scale coffee shop (best if they roast their own).  I think it's easier to appreciate taste profiles with pour-over coffee.\n","\n","Talk to the barista and ask for two pour-overs with different profiles.  the best way to tap into what you're tasting is to have a frame of reference.  Compare the two and try to describe it to yourself (or better yet share the experience with someone).  Most every coffee will have a description already from the roaster, which can be pretty helpful in knowing what to seek out.  Once you tap into that \"active\" appreciation of coffee taste, you will want to drink it, and you will want to drink it black.\n","\n","That being said, you'll have to change your morning set up a bit to get to that level of quality at home... but that's another journey. http://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Insulated-Stainless-20-Ounce/dp/B0093ISEPI/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1388073921&sr=1-1&keywords=klean+kanteen\n","\n","This may not have features that you are looking for, but I have known no better unit for keeping tastes and odors out and holding heat in.  I believe they attribute this to a restaurant-grade stainless steel (which also makes up the lid).  For me, taste is what I prioritize.  Also, a Hario V60 fits delightfully on top. If you're really on a budget (like I am), I use a hario mini mill hand grinder.  I really don't mind the manual labor, and am in no rush to upgrade to an electric (I only brew for myself, usually).  Also, I have a glass V60, digital thermometer and hario buono kettle.  I used a non-gooseneck kettle for a while and wish I had upgraded earlier.  Also, eventually I will start measuring mass, but for now I like experimenting with different coffee/water ratios.  As a result, I have become pretty good at eyeballing and getting my desired strength.  That's part of the fun anyway. I'd suggest going to a reputable coffee shop and using espresso drinks to ease into drinking real coffee.  Maybe start with a mocha (since you like the sweets), then go latte or cappuccino (both of which have plenty of milk, which is a source of sugar).  Make sure to actively seek the characters being provided by the espresso. If you're not sure what to look for, you could get a macchiato (much less milk, almost all espresso) as a reference.\n","\n","When you want to transition into brewed coffee, try and find a shop that offers pour-over coffee.  This brew method will give you a nice, clean product.  It seems that most people gravitate towards heavy sweetener use because they are trying to add flavor to coffee that doesn't have any to begin with.  Quality coffee that is brewed fresh and with care offers plenty of flavor, so all that sugar won't be necessary.\n","\n","Last point to make: talk to baristas.  If they seem friendly, they will LOVE chatting about which coffees they have to offer, and be able to point you in a good direction. Try Lindstrom's album Where You Go I Go Too.  My roommates would put this on when they got high, but my stimulant of choice is learning. I believe the legend of coffee's discovery involved a goat farmer noticed his goats acting goofy after eating the fruit containing the beans.  Kooky. Mini-mill for me.  I like being able to have the bean chamber closed off so I can walk around, don't have to worry about beans falling out.  I think it's a cool feature that the Skerton has mason jar threading, but its best to grind immediately before brewing anyway, so no need to store.\n","\n","And correct me if I'm wrong, but there is no spring attached to the burr in the Skerton.  The mini-mill has a small spring that adds a bit of pressure, keeping the top burr in place and prevents lateral movement (which would result in uneven grind particles). I'm not sure about an explanation blaming coffee for you breakout.  Are you drinking it black?  Perhaps there is an indirect influence it is having on your skin, i.e. drinking coffee may keep you from drinking enough water, or is influencing your quality of sleep/stress levels. If you're like me and living on a budget, I would suggest a hand grinder, especially if you're only making a cup at a time.  Don't be scared of the manual labor... I have actually become fond of that part of my morning routine.  I can grind out my beans during the time it takes for my water to heat up, and it gets me moving a little bit in the morning.  Plus, I truly believe that the more you put into a cup, the more you will get out of it.\n","\n","I have the Hario mini-mill, which I prefer to the Skerton because the bean chamber can be closed (and avoid beans coming out).  You have a decent amount of control over the grind setting and it's easy to clean.  Also, the money you'd be saving could be put towards other gear or high-end beans. The simplest advice I can give anyone: listen to your body.\n","\n","So much we rely on what we're told by magazines, product labels, Youtubers, and the meathead crowding the dumbbells at the gym.

The only way to define your approach to overall wellness is to try new things and assess how it affects you personally.

I just find it so odd that you could sit there looking through a telescope and watch people moving in fast-foward or slow-motion... just because they're being accelerated.  In SR I can understand time dilation as a geometrical necessity.  In GR, however, it just seems crazy.\n","\n","Is the distance between spaceships measured to be the same no matter who observes?  That is, gravity has no effect on their distance, correct?  So if they're 1 light minute apart, light takes 1 minute to get from spaceship to spaceship.  It's just that spaceship A will take much longer to respond.\n","\n","To what extent is the frequency shifted?  At some point (assuming now it is very slowly descending into the black hole), would spaceship A start seeing gamma rays being emitted from spaceship B?\n","\n","Another question.  Let's say the rocket of spaceship A were to suddenly turn off.  Would the time dilation still occur?  If so, this seems strange, since being on board spaceship A you wouldn't otherwise know you were being accelerated.\n","\n","Thanks again\n","\n","Edit: another question:  Does the frequency shift happen for other \"particles\" than photons?  For instance, there's a single very powerful magnet on board both spaceship A and B (which are 1 light minute apart).  Far outside of the black hole, at 1 light minute apart, the force of the magnets' attraction to each other was measured.  (It should be an equal force measured onboard both A and B.)  The measurement was repeated again, in their current situation (A being near black hole, B being further away).  How will the results compare?  Will the spaceships still measure the same same force? > Either way, photons interact with gravity in the same way that everything else does.\n","\n","Are you sure about this?  So you can have photons orbiting a black hole, entering and exiting the event horizon? \n","1984 Thanks, never thought of doing that. I'll make sure I use a different username!

I've actually been thinking about emailing the GAME CEO Martyn Gibbs to explain what's going on. His email is martyn.gibbs@game.co.uk My daughter gave me the idea! It is, someone should get trading standards involved! I have been emailing GAME using this email address cs@help.game.co.uk and they have replied but haven't really been any help so far. They got their money, now they couldn't give a stuff! I pre-ordered on the 17th of September and don't even have a tracking number yet - never mind the console! Anyone that only ordered on the 19th and already has their console is REALLY lucky!! 2 months GAME had to process my order, £500 spent and so far, nothing to show for it. Gutted! Yep same here... Starting to think GAME haven't really dispatched it! Shouldn't take 2 days for Royal Mail to even receive a parcel 🤦 I don't want to sound too negative but I am REALLY starting to lose patience. I ordered my PS5 on the 17th Sep at 0017 yet I have seen posts from some people who ordered theirs on launch day and have already had it delivered!! Let me know if you get your tracking info today... Nice one 👍 Still nothing here unfortunately 😅 Maybe they might get it tomorrow and deliver it on Tuesday. Maybe... Thanks for the reply! Oh well, maybe I should have left it for in store pickup, probably would have gotten it yesterday! With the weekend coming up it's starting to look like at the earliest it's gonna be delivered will be Monday or Tuesday next week... I wonder why changing the delivery address would cause so much hassle, couldn't GAME have just dispatched it to Royal Mail earlier this week and then even if RM were really busy they would at least have the package before release and maybe could have delivered it on time..? Never mind 😅 Same here, finally dispatched from GAME at 613pm on launch day! Pretty disappointing 😓 Suffice to say, it hasn't been delivered yet & I DEFINITELY won't be buying anything else from GAME in future! Royal Mail haven't even received it according to their app, although I did get a tracking number from GAMEhelp on the 18th. The email sort of lied though saying that I'd be able to track the package on launch day once Royal Mail 'updated their system' - whatever that means.. GAME hadn't even shipped the damn thing yet 🤦 Did you change your collection from in store pickup to home delivery because of lockdown in England btw?? I have one piece of advice.

In our country we aren’t used to pressing high like you do in Europe, thus after the former Benfica manager Jesus signed for us Duarte has struggled with his form. He has said that “70% of what Jesus says is new to me”. You could argue that this is Flamengo’s youth academy’s fault, but that is not the point. At the end of the day in my opinion Duarte is a physically strong CB, who is pretty quick, has a good touch, heads the ball decently despite being relatively short, but has 0 tactical awareness. I don’t see him breaking into the team if Gomez couldn’t, but if he works hard he might become important in a few years.\n","\n","I am happy with the transfer and think it was rather expensive for you.

For italian parameters however, he is not ready.\n","\n","Physically he is strong and has become pretty quick recently, he is also decent at heading despite being pretty short. He is also quite good with the ball for a defender.\n","\n","However he has one jarring flaw, which is his positioning and tactical awareness. He does not know how to be a defender and struggles with the most basic positioning, I personally believe this is Flamengo’s youth academy’s fault. If he is able to learn from what Milan has to offer, he could in a couple of years be important for the team. One can only hope you don’t have to play him before he develops though. I kind of disagree with the other brazilian in this thread lol. Brazilian football is tactically antiquated, so our football doesn’t value work rate or pressing as much as international football, and so it is less intense when compared to its european counterparts.\n","\n","Flamengo have just signed the ex-benfica manager Jesus, and Duarte has struggled to adapt to playing with a deeper back line. He is a decent CB though, very quick, good passing and ball control. \n","\n","I think he has the potential to become first team in a couple of years because he is sound physically and technically, however he really needs to improve tactically in order to truly establish himself.\n","\n","As a flamengo fan I am happy with the transfer because I think that he doesn’t have more room to grow in the local league, so we picked up the highest transfer fee we could with him.

Of course, you can eat better and exercise, but I'm a one-step-at-a-time kind of person.  Give it time, enjoy the good sleep, the heavier wallet and the hangover-free mornings.   You'll start to notice differences soon. Curious here too.   I've actually always enjoyed sparkling water, sober or otherwise. Oh yes!   Best sparkling water on the planet.

I feel like the editing on any image is really obvious if you see it next to the original!  Sure- although it was mainly trial and error!

He literally says on all his nights he does something simple and he only likes her nights when she does something elaborate. He doesn’t do extra cooking for her- just the basic version of what he makes, but expects her to do extra for him. I’ve bought concealer for my male coworker who forgot his on a business trip. I had thought he was blessed with naturally radiant skin til that point. You’re fine. Go in looking your best. I have a suspicion that it may not necessarily be the vegan thing, but the pressure to cook the more time intensive meals for your satisfaction that might be causing issue. It’s probably hurting her feelings and I don’t think you’re TA, but I wonder if there may have been some little comments or moves on your part during her dinners that were asshole adjacent and added up to this reaction. She says several different people. That’s it. Could be mutuals. This hits on the things that felt a bit off in the description of events. I read it like SIL thought she had been invited and was brushed off like it should have been obvious she wasn’t invited because it’s like she’s a brother. That part made me want to lean e-s-h even though op totally has the right to run her birth as she sees fit.\n","\n","If we’re judging on the simple question of the birth room it’s really cut and dry. If it’s more how was this handled, yeah not great from either side.\n","\n","SIL will be a very enthusiastic aunty and maybe there’s a way she can still feel like she’s supporting during the birth without being in the room. Regardless of assholery here I think there’s plenty of time to develop more of a sisterly relationship which might be more important to SIL than anything. \n","2040 Me tooo!!

I never received a tracking email but called customer service and they were able to give me the number. Ordered on the 13th, paid and shipped on the 14th and its now out for delivery. I Just pre-ordered Verizon, switching from Sprint. As a Sprint customer of over 10 years I cannot deal with the service and LTE issues anymore(This is in a major city mind you). I also needed wider coverage in more rural areas when visiting family so Verizon works for that, not really a hit on Sprint. As a developer in IT, If I talked to the public on behalf of my company I would get a stern talking to from my communications and marketing team as well as other departments.

My boobs are aching like crazy, woke up this morning with a damn head cold, I’ve also been moody and emotional. I’m trying to hold out on testing until at least 18 DPO so that I’m at day 32 in my cycle. I don’t know how I feel, one minute I’m excited that I might be pregnant cuz I just feel it  and I “know” and then the next minute I’m just anxious for my period to get here already cuz I know I’m not pregnant. Ugh!!! 🙄 Groups like this are helpful for me. And other online forums reading stories of others struggles and then successes! \n","\n","I also highly recommend meditation to help ease anxiety and get out of your head.

Didn’t hear that once with my first pregnancy with my daughter. \n","\n","The last couple days have been major boob tenderness, tiredness, super nauseated - even threw up the other evening and had foods that I normally love taste like complete crap! Normally with my period I’m crazy for chocolate and chips but haven’t wanted any of it right now. Keep getting waves of dizziness and hot flashes and heart beating faster than normal even just walking up the stairs. Ahhhh.

We’re TTC #2 and I can’t remember what my first symptoms were with baby #1 as she’s almost 3. \n","\n","But yesterday I had some weird shooting pains randomly in my boobs and then was feeling super nauseous all day and threw up everything I ate yesterday before bed.

I’m very lucky to have him Mine too, it’s all the different styles he uses that impresses me! He often makes me feel inadequate Thank you! Thank you! I’m glad you enjoyed it and found it beneficial, I hope my son looks back on it when he’s older and feels the same. Standing sensibly on his own in front of the judges was a huge step for him so I think you’re right with the confidence! I hadn’t realised, thank you! That Fort Boyard was filmed in one of the forts off the coastal city i live in, in England.. I would try to keep your personal opinions to a minimum. It sounds like she is in a relationship with a manipulator and as much as having an honest conversation with her is what you feel obliged to do, ultimately it can end up isolating her more and helping the abuser achieve their target. \n","\n","All you can do is make her feel her worth at every opportunity, make it abundantly clear that she has your support and love no matter what and if she does leave him try your best to keep mutual but supportive she may return to him. I read somewhere that victims of  abuse will try to leave their abuser 7-8 times before they escape for the final time, a fantastic support network will make her feel more capable of doing this. It needs to be 100% her decision every time and not because she has been influenced by those close to her. \n","\n","I hope you friend sees the truth and can leave before too much damage is done. Maybe your work should invest in a forklift? Go to hell I’m afraid if you try and bring this to her attention it’s only going to put her in a position where she feels like she has to choose. \n","\n","All you can really do is reaffirm how you feel about her and all the positive things she brought to experiences her family are upsetting her about. Hopefully she will eventually see it for herself but in the mean time she’s got someone who sees how great she is and that’s fantastic in itself. :)  They ran some tests but attributed it to pregnancy and ignored a lot of the historical issues I mentioned. I was diagnosed with Tietze syndrome as a teenager as I complained of a tight chest quite frequently. It seems only now that my mother had a heart attack at 55 they are taking things a bit more seriously. \n","\n","I really appreciate all the advice, my appointment is the end of next month so I will definitely bring it up! I just didn’t want to bring up something insignificant  Thank you so much for your advice and not judging me. \n","\n","I’m glad to see you’ve managed to figure things out with your husband. Sometimes the first response you hear on here is “you’re not compatible” or “leave him” and I’m more inclined to make sure you’ve tried to work through your problems. \n","\n","I will definitely try and take 5 and look at the bigger picture if I’m feeling insecure in future. \n","\n","Thank you again  I would assume not. The same with any identical twins although they have a lot of similarities one could develop to like chocolate ice cream while the other detests it - it would be a mixture of social, and environmental factors and how the individual interprets it that allows certain behaviours to arise - I can’t imagine it being too different for identical twins with autism, as autism isn’t what defines them.  What difference would it make? Each child with autism is so vastly different it’s not something you can exactly adapt to prematurely.  I brush my teeth with my little one, and he’s obsessed with Paw Patrol so I use my toothbrush to make the wobbly noise (I don’t know how else to explain it) in between my lips while going through the paw patrol catch phrases. \n","He finds it hilarious and tries to copy me, and we managed to get him to do all the different angles of his teeth as well because he finds it so funny!  If you parted on good terms it might be worth asking her if you can take a piece of her old clothing or a blanket with her smell on it to help him settle in to the new place. She would likely feel privileged that you acknowledge the dog will miss her and it's something we frequently do with our dogs to comfort them. \n","If you didn't part on good terms maybe not the best idea because it can come across creepy if you're not a dog person and she just thinks you're taking it for yourself..  The way I coped was to completely remove my partner from the situation. I started to become intimate with myself while thinking of my partner. If it ever got too much I didn't feel pressurised or guilty for stopping so I could gradually start to relate my feelings of my partner to pleasure. \n","Once I got to the point that I felt comfortable with myself doing it I invited my partner to pleasure me in the same way. It sounds selfish but what you need to focus on is building up your relationship with intimacy and condition yourself not to associate it with the past. You'll both need to be understanding of it and once you set up a safe place you can always return to it if you push yourself too far. I found there were times I believed I was ready to go back to normal but half way through started thinking of the affair so either asked to return back to him pleasuring me or if need be to me pleasuring myself. \n","When you remove the pressure and the guilt of not satisfying him and get back to a safe place where your intimacy is pleasurable rather than forced you should be able to start rebuilding what you did have in the bedroom. \n","You can work through anything if you're both on the same page you've just got to find a way that suits you.  Book her in for a pamper day (including bikini wax) beauty therapists are told in training it's their duty to tell clients if they're particularly smelly so they can go to the doctor. You seem a nice guy for treating her and don't have to have an awkward conversation in a new relationship that could leave her embarrassed.  Good on you and props to your daughter to have the confidence to express something she loves that way. I'm 23 and still don't have the Balls to even wear my league Lanyard out the house.\n","Hope my family turns out like yours one day.  I'm sorry you were served such an injustice. I hope you can come to terms with this traumatising event. \n","\n","Happy holidays :)  So if a car intentionally flashes headlights at you because you've irritated the driver you also believe that to be cruel? \n","\n","It seems he was trying to make light of an awkward situation.. I don't see anything cruel about a light being shone at you. I also don't see anything you can gain about making a fuss over this situation other than knowing that the OP doesn't find it funny to have a flashlight shone at them. You are allowed to not find a joke funny without trying to find a way to be offended by it.  \n","2047 Awesome, one exciting teaser, loved everything about it.

Because it's the truth, if you're bisexual that's who you are - you can't lie about who you are. Do the right thing and be honest.  I'm a fast thinker so I sometimes interrupt people to finish their sentences when they're talking/thinking too slow.  Why don't you care enough about yourself to be healthy? Skinny is not healthy, just love yourself enough to take care of yourself. Food does not love you. There is no least painful way. Don't lie about the reason, don't make something up.

That is strange to me. I've never felt the need to sit people down and say \"look, I need everyone to know - I'm really into astrology\". It's just not that important, you know? I guess I'm not understanding why people need to \"come out\" as atheist to their families? I keep it to myself. I'm not ashamed at all, I'm just not interested in starting family drama. \n","\n","I have a sister and her family are extreme born-agains who preach to me in every birthday card, christmas card, and gift they send.

Can you share your symptoms and also how long you did these exercises, sets etc. First things first, I am going to be harsh but I am a TOS sufferer who has been in your rabbit hole and knows where it leads and its not fun. Your first and last priority should be to fixing your TOS. Its not fun and the more you delay, the worse it becomes. Just as with any postural thing. Get PT assessment of your posture, your shoulder muscles and begin treatment. Rest will all fall in place. Its your pain & physical issues which are making you think rest is overwhelming. Not that you are weak or unable to manage. Just fix/manage your TOS and everything else will fall in place. Also, Lauren or whoever you like is nothing compared to fixing yourself. First, Last priority. Get it done and best of luck!! Hi, how long ago was the surgery, was it NTOS, where did you get it done and has it been ok thereafter? I am a TOS sufferer myself. NTOS, I think but I do have some vascular stuff going on, after a bike crash six years back. Trying PT but man is it frustrating. How did you rehab from NTOS bro? I developed NTOS after a bad bike accident several years back. I am not a weightlifter but a desk jockey, think kyphotic-lordotic posture, and am working through all the PT options for NTOS since I live in Asia where PT is lacking. Any advice would be welcome, which muscles to target, any exercises that'd help. I have a disc bulge cervical at C6-C7 and a herniated disc in my lumbar area as well, so heavy lifts are a no. Any advice welcome. Try Hatha Yoga, gently. I have TOS and its on my to do list since it (developed further by BKS Iyengar) is best for posture and strengthening. Awesome dude!! Rock on.

Thinner countries are, at the root of it, much more aware of how food makes them feel, and have healthier attitudes towards it. They know food tastes better when they're actually hungry. They know not to ruin their appetites by snacking all day between meals. They eat slower and their meal times last longer. They know they feel best when they've eaten just enough and not too much. They don't feel guilty for eating. They eat less but savor & appreciate more. Their food is also fresher & higher quality. Smaller portions are commonplace because they don't see any appeal or benefit in overeating (until you start to introduce Western ideas about food). It seems like by \"listening to your body\" you think I'm referring to some complex spiritual method of some sort, but I'm really not. Something as simple as not eating too much because you don't want to be uncomfortably full counts as listening to your body. If let's say, the average french woman was left alone with a huge plate of appetizers, do you think she'd want to down the whole thing? I doubt she'd even feel the slightest urge to do that. No self-control is being exercised on her part. Even if, let's say, restaurants in those countries serve smaller portions. That wouldn't stop them from eating 5 times as much at home or in private if they wanted to. But they don't want to. They know they can be satisfied with smaller quantities of food. \n","\n","If you gave a typical person in America a portion as small as a typical French or Japanese meal, they'd be outraged. We don't know how to be satisfied with less food here, because we're completely out of touch with how much food our bodies really need to feel satisfied. We vastly overestimate. For most thinner foreigners, it's ingrained in their culture to simply not eat more than they need (and no, this isn't determined by some government-issued calorie limit or something). And it's undeniable that people in those countries have more energy, and feel healthier day to day than the average American, without obsessing over calories & tracking macros. Often when two of my Asian friends and I have lunch, they rarely finish their plates. They say \"Ah, I'm getting full. I'll save this for later\". I highly doubt they're just secretly watching their carbs, especially because they both have the most carefree attitude towards food ever, and talk about it frequently. Maybe to them, being too full is unappealing. Maybe when they've tasted the food at it's prime (when they were hungry), they don't feel the need to continue eating. Just 10% of the French and 4% of the Japanese are obese, while America is at 33% and growing. Americans swear by counting calories and macros while most people in the first two countries have likely never done so in their lives. \n","\n","Also, your comment about them being \"sickly skinny\" is an opinion, and a seemingly biased one at that. I was talking about developed countries, ones with far lower health-related mortality rates, and higher life expectancy than America. Looking down on their body shapes won't change the fact that those people are much healthier.\n","\n","I feel like you're leaving out a lot of things I said /: It's not just about getting rid of emotional eating. Not everyone who eats too much is an emotional eater. Some people were just raised to not waste food, to clean their plate before getting desert, to eat more than they really cared for or needed to eat. Some people eat so fast they hardly taste each bite. Some people are just quick to eat when people around them are. Your ideas about food contribute significantly to how and why you eat. IE is all about unraveling all of that and adopting a totally new outlook towards food. That's the key. A relaxed, healthy relationship with food has never made anyone fat. Learning what foods & how much of it make your body & mind feel best, and eating in a way that aligns with that, has never made anyone fat. Overeating regularly isn't indicative of a healthy relationship with food. And if you have to say \"if I wasn't on this diet, I'd be overeating regularly,\" then to me, that's sort of a red flag. That's really interesting to me. But your experience with pasta & having trouble feeling full, as well as feeling perfectly light & energetic after several bowls of it, doesn't seem representative of an average person with a normal sense of hunger & fullness. I've gone to Italian restaurants and been unable to finish even a third of my bowl of pasta just because it was so massive and filling. Also people in France, for example, eat starchy and fatty foods regularly but I'm sure they don't need 4 baguettes in one sitting to feel full. However, it is your body and I guess some peoples' are just different.\n","\n","I think when something has a failure rate as high as 95%, then maybe the individual isn't to blame. Maybe in that case, it's a lot more likely for the method itself to be to blame, than for everyone to just be a bunch of incompetent losers who can't keep weight off or don't care enough to maintain it. \n","\n","If one hasn't gotten to the root of why they want to eat nonstop, then slapping a diet on top of those issues (emotional, situational, or otherwise learned, for example people who grew up being told to clean their plate & not waste food) isn't going to fix the problem. It'll fix the most apparent *symptom* of the problem, the excess weight gained from their messed up relationship with food. But it won't fix the relationship itself, which is why it's so easy for dieters to go back to their old lifestyles after losing the weight they wanted. They still have those underlying issues with food, and once they let their guard down for a second, get tired of the diet, or are faced with temptation to disobey their rules, those issues come creeping right back up again. Even if a person weighs daily (which did for years), in no way does that protect them from yo-yo-ing or overeating. When my motivation or mental strength to keep it up would become very low, no amount of increase on the scale would make it any easier for me to \"get back on track\". In fact, sometimes seeing that I gained weight would just discourage me and make it harder.\n","\n","Many people find it extremely difficult to constantly exercise self control, and to keep their guard up like that forever. For most people (perhaps not you, but many) it takes a huge amount of strength and energy, every single day. That's not a \"you just don't want it enough!\" thing. That's a human thing. You just get tired. And if something isn't a deeply ingrained, internally-motivated habit, it simply won't last without lots of continuous struggle. For something to become a deeply ingrained, internally-motivated habit, well for one, it has to be simple, enjoyable, or at the very least not significantly unpleasant. For *most* people (again, this might not be you, but this is coming from my own experience and many dieters I've known), the process of dieting is in no way pleasant, and is actually quite unpleasant. The fact that you enjoy it makes you quite a rare & lucky individual, but I can't say the majority feel that way about it /:\n"," I'm sorry you're taking it that way but making anyone feel \"stupid\" is not my intention at all. My intention is to get rid of the idea in people's heads that intuitive eating is some made up way for fat people to stay fat. That's simply not true, it's so much more than that.\n","\n","I speak so passionately about my experience because it took me years of struggling before I got to this point, and I see a little bit of my old self in everybody who says \"Yeah right. If it was that easy, why isn't everyone slim?\" I feel sad when I realize how many people actually believe, 100%, that they can't be trusted around food and a that life of dieting is the only thing that will keep them from becoming, or remaining obese & unhappy. It's so incredibly liberating to get to a point where you realize that you CAN see food in a much less stressful light.\n","\n","But I'm aware that what feels safe for others is what most will stick with, and that's fine. But I hope I can at least inspire someone around here who feels trapped like I used to. \n","2057 I just wanted to say that I feel you completely! I have been lurking this community for years and I will go through spurts of unintentional gaining following by intentional gaining and then shame fueled weight loss.  I will find that I just love my body so much more and also that I am just so much more aroused when I am heavier than when I am \"normal\".  I have always been on the normal to slightly bigger than that size and I have always been much more attracted to larger people. But I really struggle with the social acceptance of that and also my concerns about what other people think. So I have been in the closet so to speak.  I wanted to just tell you that I know exactly what you mean! \n","2058 I voted for Stein in the general but am an avid reader of The Donald subreddit.

Always be careful of rock fall. As your child gets older, always helps to have at least 3 people in the party. Two people climbing and one person watching the baby. You can rotate. Or two families with kids.  I have! I've been to The island of pabby, but not climbed much outside that. My grandmother is from glasgow Thank you so much. It makes me happy to hear you're inspired by me. Advice - you have to be flexible to get your feet up high. Helps you reach further. The other you can do is intermediate hand holds - just enough to bring your close to the rock for a long reach. Adjust your positions on holds to help optimize your reach. If it's a delicate move I breathe in it elevates me and gives me an extra inch. Patience is always crucial! Be persistent too. Thanks  I don't currently have any plans, as it will require a lot of time I don't have right now, but I may do something in Yosemite. It's still a possibility.  I think that if you place bolts in the right place it merits the route. In regards to the aging of the bolts, the stewards of the crags are responsible for the bolts - I'm not against bolts, just over bolting and the over use of them. Strong community to make sure we aren't putting in too many or in the wrong places. Thanks for your support :) I like to design things. I created a mosaic out of stone. I do love music and good food (all the 'normal' things). Design. I like to imagine things that don't exist I don't think it's other people, but rather you can read things about meditation. Buddhist philosophy interested me. I find it fascinating to read about and I've done some meditation. I find climbing as moving meditation - my way of getting into a state of pure consciousness. Thanks! Thank you for being so respectful - it didn't take away from what I was doing at that moment. Great to meet you. For anyone else - it's just about making sure I'm not in the groove of climbing / with a partner - being respectful of them! Thanks  Thanks. Listen to your body and if you're older you probably need more rest. Be careful of dynamic moves - they can be really hard on your body. Be consistent, stretch to keep your flexibility and you can also do self massage (or get). Stay in tune with your body. Thanks so much! I don't mind if people come up and want a photo - just as long as I'm not with a partner in the middle of climbing. Just want to be respectful of those I'm climbing with I have a techniques video coming out shortly - stay tuned and keep checking out website for more information. Thanks so much for your support  1) The second time I ever went climbing I realized this was my spot. First time I was so amazed by it I didn't know what to think. Once I processed it, I realized I wanted to do it as much as possible.\n","2) It actually depends on the actual climb. I would say struggle with vertical climbs with long reaches \n","3)The growth of the sport has changed the feel of the sport. Its popularity has brought a wider demo of people. The main negative is that climbing areas are more crowded - issues with trash and trail erosion. Sometimes climbing areas are closed due to protection of animals - which with less people around wouldn't be as much of an issue I don't know. Depends on indoors or outdoors?  Thank you so much. At this point I like to sleep in, hang out with friends and laugh. Some of my hobbies include: other sports (skiing, skate skiing, surfing), listen to music, dance and hang out with people I enjoy. Logically there will be the next harder thing. Naturally there will be something to expand, meaning that you can have link ups of three different routes (longer challenges) and pure difficulty and extend that. \n","I don't think there is a human limit. We always have a way to expand and evolve I think it's the wrong thing to promote. I respect people who are able to do it, but I don't think it should be what we promote as free climbers. I don't free solo, I don't want to risk my life. I have, but I don't make a practice of it. 1.) One very common way to get past a long reach is to use your flexibility. So you have to be flexible in order to bring your feet up *high.* One foot at a time, usually. So to make a high step helps when making a long reach. Another technique that i use is - besides the intermediate holds I talked about earlier - I use them as a way to reposition myself so I can make small adjustments, and I break the long move into 2-3 moves. So sometimes if there's a possibility of using an undercling hold, you can make a much longer reach, almost a full armspan, just because of the position of your hand. And another technique is to practice jumping or lunging. Because sometimes the only way to get past a long stretch is to jump! And if it's a big hold, you can actually catch the hold. But that's when you have to control your swing, and that's when it becomes difficult. \n","\n","2.) True. I believe that is true. Women are able to come much closer to what men have achieved, and in some cases do better than men. But I wouldn't say it's a blanket statement across the entire sport. Each route has a particular set of hand & footholds. And even though we all have our own style, some routes are going to favor a big person, and some routes are going to favor a small person. So whether you're a man or a woman, it's less important than your body type. However, I guess your question was more about the professional side, do women get as much attention? I think it depends on who that person is. Certain people get a lot of attention, because they have a lot of support around them, and there's interest in promoting that person. But there are a lot of *really* really good climbers whom you've never heard of. They're just doing amazing things that you don't hear about. So the media will follow certain people more than others just because of their particular situation. And that's true in a lot of different activities - sports, politics, and more. I don't think it reflects the gender issue as much as other aspects of our sport and financial aspects and other elements. There are many elements that have to do with who gets attention and how they get that.  And I like to read about philosophy. I like to go skiing, downhill skiing, I do a little bit of yoga, I like to watch movies actually! I like to sing. I like to dance. When I'm by myself, or I'll dance if I'm doing out. But the singing part I usually sing in my car. I have a son who's 12, and I like to hang out with him. He's into Parkour. And it's fun to watch him. He's *really* creative. In Parkour they don't linear flips like in gymnastics. It's like sideways spinning, and I like to see him be creative and do cool moves. Let's see, what else do I like ? I really do like to travel. I haven't done as much as I would normally but, but i enjoy seeing other places in the world. I think it allows us a chance to ask ourselves questions about our own culture and our philosophy toward life. I think it's interesting to get out of our comfort zones. I like to create mosaics. I did one in my kitchen made out of stone, modeled after Venice - I bought a book in Italy, and took a picture and made a backsplash in my kitchen out of mosaics. I also like to read & speak foreign languages. I speak French and Italian and a  little bit of Spanish. So i enjoy the process of learning to speak each language.  Hmmm. I haven't been there in a long time. The only place I've been really is Turkey Rock, and I remember it being interesting granite climbing - thin cracks and interesting edges on the wall. So I intend to go to the southwest soon!  It's always been a challenge for me to explain why I love to climb, and what is free climbing, just the term itself.\n","\n","People think that free climbing is climbing without a rope. And I really don't appreciate the sensational approach by the media to show people climbing without a rope. I think there's a beauty in rock climbing that is difficult to explain, so oftentimes what you see in the media is the sensational. Like climbing without a rope, or doing something that is clearly dramatic. And that doesn't explain *why* we climb.\n","\n"," Well, I think that for me it's about the challenge itself.\n","\n","Midnight Lightning, when I did it, hadn't been done by a woman, and that wasn't why I wanted to do it necessarily. I wanted to do Midnight Lighting because that boulder itself attracted me.\n","\n","I don't think my objective is to be the \"first woman.\" That's not one of my criteria. It never was. When I started pushing myself through climbing, I was really around mostly men, but I did have one friend named Mary Gingery, who would climb more similarly to the way I climbed because she wasn't as tall as the men - she was taller than me, but not that tall - so we had a different approach, not only because of our size, but because of our personalities, the way we used more flexibility. So we used our strength as people, as women, either way I don't like to distinguish only by gender. I think it's more based on your specific qualities as a person. I am a woman. But I'm also small, which gives me a disadvantage in some situations where there are big reaches. But it gives me advantages in other situations that are hard to quantify - I weigh less, so each hold feels a bit bigger to smaller hands, so you get better leverage on the holds. *BUT* when you have to make a long reach, and I'm in a position of an iron cross, that's very strenuous. My strength to weight ratio has to be higher, I have to be stronger for my body weight, to make up for that. \n","\n","So my simple answer is: because they're pioneering in general.\n","\n","And because those objectives personally challenge *me,* and I think it's fascinating to try to optimize in every way possible, because that's part of being a living creature. We always try to do it better and optimize for our own survival. It's natural.\n","\n","And thank you. The answer to the question is YES, it's changed a lot. Because first of all, I didn't know anything about climbing when I started. There weren't very many women involved in the sport, therefore there weren't very many role models. I think that now we see a lot of really strong women, and also young girls, like Ashima Shiraishi, she did in a very quick time the hardest route done by a woman today, and she's only 14. So Ashima is one of those that I enjoy watching as a climber for a number of reasons (in regards to who you like to watch to climb). But I also think she's got a great attitude. She's a hard worker. She believes in herself obviously because she's proven it time and time again that she's capable of doing things nobody thought were possible. When she did some of the things that were *record-breaking* as a ten-year old, she was making BIG moves, and I don't know how she was able to do that. I think she had to jump a lot. Because when you're small, and you can't reach something, you don't have many options. You either jump, and sometimes jumping creates too much force and you swing off anyway, or you try to find an alternative sequence, a different set of handholds that go in a slightly different direction, or maybe you find an intermediate handhold that's just enough to find you leverage to get beyond it - like big people wouldn't even look at it as a handhold. But if you're small, you can use an intermediate hold to get past it. But *sometimes* there just isn't one.\n","\n","I think that who you are and what your level of experience is affects how male climbers treat you. If you're going with your boyfriend, and you've never climbed before as a woman, then men will probably cater to you more so than if it was a man. So men that climb for the first time don't climb as well as women, typically. Why? Because men rely more on their upper body strength, and they don't use their feet as well as women. So a lot of times women have a more graceful and efficient approach - they aren't just hauling themselves up with their arms, they're using their feet in a more technical manner.\n","\n","And they're more graceful to watch.  Yes, actually my hotel is right across the street from where it took place in 1989! But no, we were in NYC in a studio where he did his show back then. And no, he didn't go outside with me. But Tom Brokaw, who was in the same building, came and climbed a few moves on the wall in his nice dress shoes - he heard I was in the studio, and came down to say hello because we had some mutual friends.  Hmmm.\n","\n","Well, in recent past, I did a climb called \"Living in Fear.\" It's in Rifle, Colorado. And so it was really overhanging, with big moves that required precision and a lot of strength. And there really wasn't a place where I could stop and relax. So I had to be really fit to do it. For the amount of time that I had to train, just a 3.5 hour drive one-way. The day I did it, I drove out and back in the same day, because that's all the strength I had. \n","\n","But I would say the Nose was a more difficult claim. It's gotten a higher rating. And it's a much longer climb, and required a lot more mental skills as far as keeping my cool, not feeling too much pressure, relaxing so I could listen to my intuition. So the Nose is the most difficult climbs that I've done. But there are harder technical climbs even on smaller boulders that I find challenging. \n","\n","Like Midnight Lightning (also in Yosemite). When I first looked at it, as a young climber, i didn't think it was possible for me because there were some big reaches, and I came to Yosemite in 1998 to do the first free ascent of another route, but it was the year of El Nino, and actually that's the name of that climb now, is \"El Nino,\" and we couldn't climb it because it was too wet. So I went to Camp 4 where Midnight Lightning is, and I had the time to try it more than just a passing try. I tried - i spent a day there, and I finally did do it.\n","\n","It was very strenuous. It involved jumping to a small edge that looked like a lightning bolt - that's why the name is Midnight Lightning - and I had it where one foot came *off* the rock, and it was very difficult because it involved power and precision at the same time.\n","\n","So that was an example of something that I thought was difficult as well, but on a different scale.\n","\n","So that's the boulder, and Living in Fear is a rock climb that's maybe not even 100 feet long, but it's difficult for every move. El Capitan is even longer, and the difficulty is varied. But the rating of the hardest section is 514A. \n","2066 advertising\n","\n","\n","^sent ^from ^my ^phone ^thats ^better ^than ^iphone well chomp isn't technically a chocolate, since its ingredients don't list convention to be classified as such (chomps technically classify as a candy or hard boiled sweet) even though it has a wafer and significant flavouring \n","2067 I was wondering the same. I love this, but I don’t think it’ll age well. the editing on this is great. it's so unique and rly fun to watch!! i'd be super interested in seeing more like this! do you have a youtube channel or anything? i don't think that poking fun of people on the internet for their goofy shirts is quite on par with harassing a couple in public for their sexuality, but i guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. i think the whole point is that the lgbtq+ community is constantly demonized for \"forcing\" our sexuality onto others, when meanwhile heterosexual couples do this all the time, like shown with these shirts. it's a double standard and it's pretty ridiculous that i get harassed for holding my girlfriend's hand in public because i'm \"forcing\" my sexuality onto others, while the same woman berating me for this has her toddler in a shirt that says \"LADIES MAN\" or something similar.\n","\n","i agree that the sub OP mentioned can be a little overzealous sometimes but like...you have to understand the context. too faced needs to just sponsor me at this point because i recommend their just peachy foundation to EVERYONE i know. it's completely transfer proof on its own, but my routine is moisturizer, primer, loose powder, just peachy foundation, UD setting spray and it lasts like literally all day and night. i was working 10-12 hour days at one point, then going out, and i'd come home and my skin would still look amazing. it's buildable coverage, too. it's medium to start off with but you can build it up, although i don't think you'll ever be able to achieve like FULL full coverage with it. \n","\n","also i know it's not anyone's fav concealer but UD naked concealer melts PERFECTLY with too faced just peachy foundation. the formulas work together so well and make my skin look flawless. like, i have problematic skin with a lot of redness and HUGE pores (i know everyone says they have big pores but my skin truly has the texture of an orange rind on my cheeks and nose) and this combo genuinely makes them completely disappear. it's fucking witchcraft. i love it. i love her lil space hamsters too!! i do prefer her lil gothic doll aesthetic though. i think riot is getting rly good at making base skins appealing. there are quite a few newer champs whose base skin i prefer to their release skin. yeah, i was originally on the fence about her since i think she doesn't fit in with league's aesthetic but the more i see of her the more i fall in love. seraphine 2.0 i guess.\n","\n","i love how gwen's spells give an rly accurate visual idea of what they do, like playing against her without knowing what any of her spells do, you'd still have a pretty good idea of how she works and what's happening. i appreciate that design a lot. good for her. hate to say it, but this is true. i mained taric religiously from his rework up until this season. between him getting the short end of the stick with nerfs from funneling with yi + the lack of mana options for him with the new items, he's dead.\n","\n","it sucks because his playstyle is truly SO unique and i haven't been able to find another champion that scratches that itch for me. the closest i've kind of come is rakan, but it's not the same.

He needs to get his pain threshold back to a normal level - and the way to do this is sound therapy. Tinnitus Retraining Therapy is a very good solution.

And it comes in black, which is sleek as all hell. https://www.soundofsleep.com/product/lectrofan-black/\n","\n","If you like ocean sounds and babbling brooks, which I preferred for a while, my favorite was the HoMedics sound spa. Pretty cheap too!\n","https://www.amazon.com/HoMedics-SS-2000G-Relaxation-Machine-Nature/dp/B00A2JBMRE/ref=pd_lpo_121_bs_lp_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=81DT165C84J1HX950BM4 It is great that your tinnitus didn't get worse from clubbing, and I am not telling you to shut yourself in just because of tinnitus. That would be bad advice.\n","\n","I am just trying to give you the advice I wish someone gave me! Hearing damage is cumulative and the music at clubs is set to damaging levels. It just seems like such an unnecessary risk, since there is a lot more fun to life than clubbing. But if it is important to you, I guess just plug up and enjoy. I've had tinnitus for almost 10 years now, and I actually love getting colds - they always lower my tinnitus. I've stopped asking why and just learned to sit back and enjoy it while it lasts. It is called Hyperacusis, and often goes hand-in-hand with tinnitus. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis Hearos 33db: https://www.amazon.com/Hearos-Plugs-Xtreme-Protection-pairs/dp/B001EPQ86A  Are you talking about fleeting tinnitus, i.e. 10-15 second bursts of super high pitched tinnitus? If so, it has nothing to do with your constant tinnitus and is nothing to worry about. Everyone gets fleeting tinnitus, including people without tinnitus.  Try getting a massage or doing some yoga - something to trigger deep relaxation. Maybe some heating pads on your neck? Just try to avoid silence, and listening for your tinnitus. It will probably go away if it is just from tension in your head and neck.  The internet is full of terrible terrible advice when it comes to tinnitus. Please let me give you some good advice - stop going to clubs if you have tinnitus. Your life will not be anything less. It will be better for it.  this is so cute I wish it was me.  Is it just me or do Rubio and Christie look like they've been hit in their (tiny) penises? He says his kids would run Trump Org if, universe forbid, he wins, but those same kids advised him to ditch Lewandowski. They are his most trusted political advisors. Every decision he would make would be in best interests of his company.  So he proposes to have a conversation about something that makes him uncomfortable, then postpones, you get mad and cut off communication by saying \"goodnight\" and then get upset when he doesn't respond to your calls and texts? It sounds like you have some serious communication issues. It's only been a month...if you don't want to be patient and give him some space on this, maybe this isn't a match.  Pandering to Trump supporters in order to get re-elected. This could have been a seminal moment for him, standing up for American values. Instead he decides to utterly disgrace himself.  I found this especially poignant: \"Jo Cox, however, was not just any MP doing her duty. She was also an MP who was driven by an ideal. The former charity worker explained what that ideal was as eloquently as anyone could in her maiden speech last year. “Our communities have been deeply enhanced by immigration,” she insisted, “be it of Irish Catholics across the constituency or of Muslims from Gujarat in India or from Pakistan, principally from Kashmir. While we celebrate our diversity, what surprises me time and time again as I travel around the constituency is that we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us.”\" Agreed. He called you 'brother' at one point, so that is what you should be until he figures himself out.  My family is not very open or verbal, so the idea of a sit-down, emotional discussion was off the table. I also felt like they always knew - I never brought home or talked about girls, so decided to make the whole thing really nonchalant. My mom was asking me if she could set me up with some of the single girls at her office, and asked what my \"type\" was. I paused for a few seconds, debating whether this should be the moment. I just went for it, and said \"not girls.\" She asked me if that meant I only like boys. I said yes, she giggled and asked why I would want to do that. She went back to reading her magazine, which was confusing because I expected her to cry. I literally asked her \"Aren't you going to cry now or something?\" She thought I was kidding, but when I said I wasn't, she didn't seem to care. She just said that I shouldn't judge my sister's husbands/boyfriends, since there will be people out there who will criticize me. That was it. She told my dad, and he never said anything about it. He just hugged me a few days later, and I knew that was his moment. Nothing changed after that, in fact, my mom started chatting with me more, almost like I was her new gay best friend. I consider myself lucky. \n","2073 This sounds awesome. I live in Eastern US and looking to exchange with any European country. Let me know if you want to move forward.

Are you talking about printscreening? 2Based A 53% WR with such a high pickrate in pro games is great. Remember, DP is first pick first ban material and any team letting it through tries thoroughly to counter her. It isn't simply accurate to look at winrate here. Did some checking, on D2protracker DK has a 54.6%wr on the offlane with a high pickrate and a 41% wr on mid. So I guess offlane DK is quite decent. \n","\n","Furthermore, Dotabuff shows a 52.88% wr overall in the divine/immortal bracket.\n","\n","So wrt to pubs DK does seem like a meta offlane pick if the poor major performance is ignored(pros play differently enough in officials that the difference in wr is explicable). Either way, I think DK is a decent pick in the offlane Welp guess I'm wrong I'm pretty sure DK is quite decent if not good this patch. Seen a lot of pros and high rankers pick it and win. Might be wrong tho. Really good. They pretty much melt. >He's been pretty solid since Liquid now hasn't he?\n","\n","Yeah but he isn't a 13k redditor is he? !optin what does OTP mean? I mean PL illusions really don't get the benefit of radiance since they don't last long enough. It would be very funny if there was a negative overflow error where when he goes negative he hits immortal rank 1 Arty is a class that WG has never been able to balance properly. Most people have disliked the class from its inception. The stun mechanic was never well received. The class that was supposed to \"stop camping\" mostly just encouraged it. It is a class that has widely deviated from its intention. \n","\n","My point is this, WG has not been able to \"fix\" the class by making it fun to play(for most people) and play against. There is little counterplay too. The wheeled vehicles have similar issues. \n","\n","The other problems you raised are just dumb. There is some counterplay to all of those. Sniping from out of range is fixed by scouts(light tanks/wheeled vehicles) and flanking. Tanks with bigger guns can be dealt with by taking dps trades vs singular alpha trades or letting the tanks with higher HP/better armour fight them while you flank/gain map advantage.   \n","\n","\n","The only two possibilities to counterplay arty is to: a) Sit behind a building/rock which is very entertaining. b) Rushing the arty with lights/wheeled vehicles. Arties have a very shitty risk vs reward other than their long firing cooldowns. TDs always have to fear being spotted when you fire(of course you can do the hide 15m behind bush thing to make it less likely) and they are usually squishy/very slow/long cooldown if you fuck up.\n","\n","At the end of the day, my opinion is that arty detracts more than what it provides. I think there are better ways to solve camping that don't involve arty and adding a shitty class is never a solution to good map and game design. Yes and no. I think the game definitely is better now than it was in 2010/2011 but there are decisions made by WG that did make the game a lot less fun and popular. The peak for this game was definitely 2015-2016 around the time of Sweden being added but even then, the problems did show. Arty was a problem(why they don't get rid of this class I'll never know), premiums were already getting better and better, some maps were just dreadful, and gold ammo was becoming more and more prevalent and necessary. fAkE TaXi dotr cums Can we please stop with this stupid 69 funny number shit. It's so old and overused. Why fix a feature? Is the community really much more toxic than others? I recently picked up Valorant in an interest to try out the game. I straight up got flamed the first unranked game I played both in VC and in chat and the second game my team flamed someone else. Do consider valorant unranked games are usually shorter than most Dota 2 games. I had the same experiences in Apex and CSGO. \n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","I'm not in anyway justifying our toxicity. But it doesn't feel like something that is a unique problem to Dota. All games seem to have a community that is toxic to newer players. Opt in naH indie uses cowlololololol On a more serious note, this is what OpenAI seemed to do really well. I remember seeing CMs and Gyro supps being surprisingly farmed and the gold graph being relatively even. Always interesting how a different entity, in a slightly different game, creates a different meta. Pretty sure that's cause of the new smurf detection system that matches you up with boosters and smurfs more often if you are detected as a smurf.

There are many ways to record screens and these attacks are becoming cheaper and easier. Brainwallets are vulnerable to all sorts of screen recorders: (TEMPEST is not that difficult!), (X-ray, invisible) cameras, GPU firmware malware, tampered monitor. Not too hard to store small things in a safe such as drives, keyboards, mice, and motherboards. A full-sized monitor is another story.\n","\n","##Secure brainwallets\n","\n","Brainwallets make convenient paper wallets and encrypted files. They have certain security advantages:\n","\n","* If you memorize (and don't forget) it, everything can be lost or taken and you can still recover the wallet.\n","* If you want to create an unencrypted paper wallet you don't have to trust printers which sometimes record/cache things or even send them to the printer's manufacturer before they are printed (that's so you don't have to install drivers!)\n","* If the computer you use to create the brainwallet, is compromised at that time, you could run your operating system from read-only media with no place for it to store your secret. Being that read-only optical drives are usually on x86 machines and x86 machines usually have firmware, this may not be possible. Instead you can [do it with a single board computer](/r/cryptonomics/comments/5xd89u/offline_signing_with_single_board_computers_vs_pc/) and destroy the cheap computer or just the SD card if it has no other writable firmware. You must test that this potentially compromised computer still creates correct transactions, by testing it constantly. What if it only creates a bad transaction occasionally? Best to create many test transactions so you are more likely to catch that in a test.\n","\n","Then you must have a mobile device with adequate camera/TEMPEST shielding/space, etc and, when you move the tokens, you write out raw transactions (human bridge) or convert them into QR codes (camera bridge). > Congratulations on the good work!\n","\n","Thanks it was hell! =D >What is \"the delegation game\" which will determine the first 100 validators?\n","\n","It is explained more in the \"[whitepaper](https://cosmos.network/whitepaper)\" (which is not really like a whitepaper because they keep changing it) in the section \"Becoming a Validator After Genesis Day\". I imagine the delegation game is where validators campaign for delegates and atom is traded as the stakes get higher. When a validator has less atom delegated to them then a hundred validators above them, they are bumped off and all the atom delegated to them are freed. If stakes get too high your favored validator may give up and so you may rather sell your atom or be unable to afford to bet. Undelegated atom may not be the best investment (compared with ETH, for example) with such high block rewards going to delegates, thus you may want to sell as others are buying to stay in the game. Eventually it could stabilize where no one has enough atom (or will) to bump off the lowest validator. Then the game is over but for the occasional shuffling at the bottom. ##Intro to Qubes\n","\n","Qubes is a high security OS. It can be installed on most PCs but I'm not sure how secure that is and you can't use internal DVD drives easily on any hardware. \n","\n","##\"Secure\" hardware \n","\n","(\"Secure\" ignoring the [flaws of x86](/r/cryptonomics/comments/5xd89u/offline_signing_with_single_board_computers_vs_pc/) or you could destroy/replace all the firmware maybe including the CPU and GPU if you don't mind the cost/hassle.)\n","\n","For better security use [hardware that supports Qubes advanced features](https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/).

Maybe not if a proposal to have a persistent fork passed but I think that this situation would have to be in the Constitution for that to happen. Or they may have put the \"immutability\" commitment in the Constitution without anticipating how much ether would be involved. I'm not sure that would have been a better situation than having no \"pre-plan\". Always good to look ahead just must be careful about (unnecessary) commitments with inadequate info.

If that's all, to me it sounds like a pretty easy thing to get 100% right\n","\n","If that were true this PoS makes PoW completely obsolete. The question is which system has to pay validators/miners more for an equivalent level of security. The bicoinomists think they can secure PoW with no block rewards. This is untested and controversial. Unless it is extremely difficult to secure a server, (bonded) PoS can offer far greater security for the cost.  \n","\n",">the only 'arms-race' is having a reliable system of redundant nodes\n","\n","Because it is so easy to secure a server? These \"arms\" are far more useful and distributed than the Bitcoin ASIC (the best of which are by a few manufactures AFAIK).\n","\n",">unless verifiers start trying to hack/DoS each other \n","\n","It is not just other validators it is: states, competing blockchains, anyone who can bypass your security (with physical access, etc).

Maybe I am answering my own question here - but is that what PoS proponents are really signing up for?\n","\n","Only the **validators** of bonded PoS like Tendermint/[Cosmos](/r/thecosmos) (token sale in March!) or Casper. **The hodlers who aren't validators benefit from less dilution of the currency (or greater security) and greater demand for the token (for staking).** Naive PoS can have cold locked stake where their private key for staking can only be used to send funds to another (offline) address. With Casper the \"hacker\" could use your key to create a double signature and frame you (I call it a \"framing attack\") and get 10% of your deposit (last I checked). They can't get the whole deposit but you lose the whole thing.\n","\n","If that is all the hacker does, this **achieves the goal** of protecting the network from insecure validators. The only way PoW is more secure from hacking is if the hackers are able to get enough keys to double spend, for at least one client (at a time). If all these 10%-of-deposit-rewards isn't enough to deter the hacker, or if they are fairly certain they can still get the reward while sending a double signature to someone else, then they could fool a client with a double spend. They would need to control the internet connection of those the clients they want to fool. So if you are so \"paranoid\" to think the NSA/etc could collect a supermajority of keys and fool your client without your client being able to report it (because they control your connection all the time?) then you can't trust your client or the network (because no one reports these double signatures). Seems like it would be much easier to hack the clients, either with a the-man-in-the-middle attack when you download your Bitcoin client. So PoW is secure from this if you write your own client, read the source code, or trust/hire someone who does this for you. For everyone who trusts the source of their software, bonded PoS is far more secure for the cost (in currency dilution to pay block rewards). It is still easier to attack each weak little client (with unverifiable firmware, etc) and PoW won't help here, neither.  >The constitution doesn't enforce anything automatically at the protocol level.

Then once the device manufactures update their phone-specific versions it gets pushed out to carriers. Then the carriers update their localized versions of Android and push it to users. Android updates are painfully slow as a result and older devices may never get an update at all. With an iPhone the updates are able to get pushed out more quickly because there are fewer hardware platforms to account for, plus the OS developer and hardware manufacture are the same company.

But if I can't find enough positive replies here that promote the use of \"zoning\" in MMORPG's over the seamless MMO's then I will probably have to do it the hard way and go with seamless but I would prefer going with Zoning if I find out its not all that bad... game design is not only about designing the best possible game as if you had blizzard studio at your fingertips, you also have to design it so that less talented and very small indy teams could create the game if you don't have blizzard studio waiting for your GDD. \n","So in this case I'm looking for design suggestions on how you can make zoning work well enough to make a zoning mmorpg.\n","\n","And on your first paragraph I'm honestly not sure what exactly you mean.. Personally I would prefer a generic MMO over a generic multiplayer game.. for example a generic MOBA(dota,lol,hon,etc) game is not more fun IMHO than a generic MMORPG like planetside 2, world of warcraft, darkfall online, etc.. and the reasons for this is that I find MMORPG's more immersive, persistent. hmm, how big were the zones if it was 5 loading screens? I think its important to have really really big zones so that running from one edge of a zone to the other might take at least 15 minutes (if you take the birds path (straight) but if you design the map so there are no straight paths it can take even longer maybe 30 mins.. then the loading screens might not be too bad anymore?  Hmm, I was thinking that would be another disadvantage with zones about knowing where they will enter and leave.. because it creates camping spots for PvP.. where players will wait for someone to enter the zone or leave the zone.. and kill them.\n","\n","What do you think about that.. I mean sure PvP doesnt have to be nonconsensual in every game, but lets go with that in this example..

The way he separates his scenes is very intuitive and it's written very efficiently. \n","\n","Some others I liked were: Prisoners, Lady Bird, and most recently Robert Eggers' The Witch and Nosferatu. Just gonna copy and paste what I wrote on Letterboxd:\n","\n","I'm a fan of James Gray's previous work in The Lost City of Z, but in the ways that film succeeds, Ad Astra falls short for me. \n","\n","Ad Astra starts off strong, with beautiful cinematography and an event that sets up stakes that soon will be too familiar. The story at heart is a small and simple one set amongst the backdrop of the dark and endless plane of space. A space that now has been commercialized, established and explored to an extent - but it's still just a stepping stone for the possibilities in the limitless void. \n","\n","Where Ad Astra really loses me is in that very story itself. Many events feeling disconnected, stories that work alone, but don't come together smoothly enough to create a cohesive narrative. From space pirates, space monkeys, and almost space mutiny, but at the end of it all what is the purpose? To serve as 'cool' scenes, as blockades for our protagonist, to add some runtime but fail at fundamentally changing our hero. Some characters even having no purpose other than to serve that protagonist, narration included to tell us what should be visualized. Then at the stories final pivotal moment, a moment that was set-up to be at the very least an emotional gut-punch, after a twist that's as dangerous as warm milk, is given no time and reduced to being forgetful. Ad Astra wants to say a lot about the complex dynamics of a fucked-up father-son relationship or masculinity as a whole but only does so in a whisper. \n","\n","There is a lot to love here, really. Cinematography, a no-surprise great performance out of Brad Pitt, and a story that has the roots of it but just needs a little more time to be fleshed out. Don't get me wrong this is a good movie and the only reason I'm being harsh on it is because it had the potential to be a great one instead. Good luck! A day-night system could be cool too. Something that could be interesting for vampires. There's only a 1/50000 chance. Sure and thanks! Not out yet but if you can get your hands on Robert Eggers' Nosferstu script, you'll be in for a treat. They literally reverted this change in today's Gwent patch. I wouldn't worry about it. With the way they have been pushing character customization in Cyberpunk - a create your own Witcher style game seems probable. If they went back in time to the Era of when Witcher schools were strong and you picked a school, starting from there sounds dope.

Congrats on the windfall I am re-reading the books right now, just finished the first one and I've got to say that the first movie does the book a lot of justice, especially the later chapters which feel overly rushed in the book. The first book could have been another 50 pages and more comfortably spread the majority of the storyline. There are small features as well in the challenges for the stone which are done better in the film than the book and there are some that should have been included in the film to make it better. When reading it I also noticed that Rowling tried to hint towards Quirrell being the main villain by there being a knocked out troll in the challenges, this was better excluded from the film as it was done poorly in the book where it was 2-3 pages before Quirrells reveal rather than being an earlier challenge right after the vines. Just ordered one from Finisterre yesterday, can't wait for it to arrive.\n","\n","Only negative is that I think its only got a lined collar and I kind of wanted the full lining. In case it turns out to be a deal-breaker, anyone know where #2 is from? Thanks for the post, you can tell there has been loads of research especially with the detail into individual players. I also enjoy not skewing results for individual players as it attempts to give value to the draft regardless of teams played for e.g. Kawhi may have earned an all-nba first team throughout his career but did he benefit massively from being drafted by the Spurs, a safer assumption is that on any given team he would earn atleast one.\n","\n","Unfortunately I agree with others that the methodology has a lot of shortcomings. Most notably for me is the inclusions of 6moy, mip and hall of fame.   \n","\n","\n","6 MOY: essentially means you are the 2nd/3rd best of a position in a team, assuming this isnt benefited by your teams final position that means you are approx 60-90th best at your position in any given year. While this is a great statistic for showing good role players in a draft it is massively worse that being 6-10th best in the whole league and 11-15th best, but points-wise it is equal to the former and twice as valuable as the latter. The award is similar to the [wooden spoon award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_spoon_(award)) in that it awards mediocrity (I get they are still insane top few hundred/thousand players ever).\n","\n","MIP: similarly to the above it diminishes more valuable players with AN2 and AN3. But there is another issue: it should have counted towards the multiple awards because ([no reference to it here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Improved_Player_Award), but happy to be proved wrong) no player who achieved a more valuable award later achieved MIP, at best there are players who achieved it the same season.\n","\n","Hall of Fame: this one annoyed me quite a lot because it gave 2002 an unnecessary buff to their score and a pretty obscene one at that. While I enjoy that this draft doesn't benefit longevity because if the drafts happened differently career ending injuries could possibly have been avoided, this stat essentially benefits longevity. Yao had awards for a lot more years than the average nba career length which is why he got HoF but if you take say dRose who may not get HoF despite having higher highs than Yao it explains pretty quickly why its imbalanced towards longevity. The average nba career is 4 years which doesn't exclude any drafts here, but the average career length of award winning players (the majority of points awarded with this mechanism) it scales up to [14 years](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/46722356.pdf). The only drafts that are 14 or more years are 2000-2006, less than half the available teams have even reached the average end of career length for award winning players so have no chance of getting that buff of 5 points. This award also takes many years to complete with a minimum of [5 years of retirement](https://www.hoophall.com/about/about-hall/our-mission/election-process/), including that with the average award winning career (awc) length is a total of 19 years which means that only 2000 and 2001 should be getting average awc length players getting into the HoF now. Whats more is that despite this being a longevity award it actually punishes multiple current players for the extreme longevity: [23 players](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/bio/?sort=DRAFT_YEAR&dir=-1) current players have played since 2006 or before, Yao won this award so early because his career was just over half the average awc length at only 8 seasons. I think if you were to include this stat it should use [HoF probabilities](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html) and have them weighted against their career length as to whether we can predict they get it or not e.g. while Giannis currently has a lower percentage than John Wall, ignoring injuries he started his career 3 years later so should be more likely at an equal point of time (end of career).\n","\n","Including 2014 and 2015: I just personally dont think this should have been done, still to early and its shown by 2015 being the supposed worst draft and 2014 being the second worst.\n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Adaptions: I'm going to start the adaptions with the fact I won't being doing any more research into individual careers because I cant be arsed right now, so because of that I will be excluding MIP and HoF because I stated above they should be manipulated which is a lot of work. I also liked someone elses suggestion of weight multiple similar awards but again cant be bothered to do any of that work. I have always hated 6MoY so I an excluding that as well and I dont think 14 and 15 have got to a point far enough into their careers yet so them as well.

Tried to pump myself into running again doing short runs every day for a month, but between the heat of the summer and no goal to aim with my runs were getting later into the evening and shorter in distance. A couple days after I had ran for the whole month I decided enough was enough as I hadn't ran anything longer than 5k and most of my runs were 3-4k at around 11:30 at night. I decided I would take a couple weeks off but with the goal of relaxing and getting into the mindset of going back with my normal longer runs and at least a 10k once a week. That did not go to plan as a couple days after I pinched a nerve in my back so that was me out of exercise for a few weeks, then as I was getting back to health I hurt my foot and was out again before I had even started.\n","\n","2 months later and I'm back, I knew I needed to do a long run to remind myself how it felt and stop myself spiralling into shorter runs as it gets cold.

The first runner ran past the dog walkers and they definitely noticed me coming up as well, but decided to continue standing in the centre of the path. The dogs started playfighting with each other and the owners did nothing, as I ran past I moved as far across the path as I could. French bulldogs when they play become Fr~~enchbulld~~ogs (frogs) and leap, this one did exactly that with no restraint right between my legs.

Where I lived, we practiced having drills of only a few minutes warning between submarine launch detected by satellite and when it hit. \n","\n","So, I am still numb to any early warning or not, after all these years.  I think most people much younger than me simply do not understand that millions of older people simply are very fatalistic about such early warning systems, and their worth Its because nobody was surprised; it would have been news had those messages been rational, empathetic or constructive (pick 2)\n","\n","Here, for some reason, the public expects an agency handling such doomsday weapons to be a bit more ... professional ? So, basically, the shield is used to support overseas deployments and not attacks on US soil ?  I mean, it can and should do both. But, realistically, nobody is going to attack the mainland US, because we are a bunch of crazy SOBs who will turn entire nations into piles of radioactive dust to avenge attacks.\n","\n","So, barring that, these deployments are only going to be used to protect overseas troops deployed to hostile areas A truth discovered in ancient ruins dating back to pre-history I appreciate that summary! See, this I can relate to, when its put like that. Now I can equate it to what I know in other places. Now, I know you might disagree, but this is where I come from mentally. Yes, its a tragedy, but there is no solution short term. Long term, if you look at how other problem areas lifted themselves out of a hole like this, is through trade, even if most of that trade, at least at first, is with the very bad guys you would like to kill. \n","\n","There really is no better solution for many places in the world except for increased globalization , ease of transfer of wealth, and making it easier to do business in a region. Its not a good solution. No. But, its the best there is, the only solution, in many places >  To be honest the only way I see a peace from this is if every other fighting force joined up, went on the offensive with an outside backer and crushed the Tatmadaw utterly.\n","\n","Again, I have not much knowledge of this area, but I have never seen the above scenario work out. I mean, it would be one thing if the Tatmadaw were politically isolated and vulnerable. But, I am guessing they are not, considering they have survived this long, and there is probably a significant amount of regular people who have their own reasons for wanting to fight for them, rather than against,  if push came to shove. \n","\n","I have seen some pretty bad governments, or setups, slowly change for the better as trade with everyone slowly increased. I think this works, in the long run, even if the people who are collecting 90% of the wealth are total scumbags\n","\n","So, if I were in charge of the world, what I would do is find a way to get more wealth and trade to all major groups, and then let things get better in a generation or two I'd be lying if I said I knew what each of those groups really were, or did, other than some brief characterizations I have in my mind. \n","\n","It sounds complex though, but if there is any deep similarity between what you sketched out and what I know about other places. I think the only thing that will help is an influx of trade, and money to all people, including the Tatmadaw, instead of sanctions. Because as bad as things might be, places generally get better over many years if there is a higher and higher amount of standard of living, trade, even if the feudal lords are getting a disproportionate amount of it\n","\n","But, I sense increasing amounts of sanctions in the next few months, coming in, making the situation worse and starting a circling of the wagons be more .. whatever will come of it Once, someone on a Syrian war subreddit drew a diagram with all the fighting groups and their alliances. At the time, he drew 18 groups and countries, and they all had different , and sometimes temporary , relationships, or lack there-of , with many others.  There were at least a hundred lines, or at least that is how I remember it\n","\n","Myanmar seems to have several early parallels here\n","\n","And, when you said that about the different groups being terrified about each other, it reminded me of something else I learned despite myself. Each group in Syria, even the best and the worst, all had their war criminals, bad actions, good guys and legit people who were trying to do the right thing. Every group, even Isis. And motivations were seldom black and white, or good and bad. It really depended on who your people were, or where you came from.\n","\n","I guess Myanmar might be similar. And nothing can be done by outsiders, except to make it worse, perhaps So, I used to follow the Syrian war, and while I was not following events live at the very beginning of it; I know enough about how things went south at the start of it it to begin to have flashbacks here\n","\n","I don't know much about politics and the military, well at least I cannot be called an expert about anything except how to make some software. \n","\n","But the one think I personally learned about Syria is when the government is shooting protesters;  giving the protesters heavy weapons, a supply chain, and a way to survive as a group is not just making a road to hell with good intentions, its throwing a whole country into hellfire \n","2117 There is a story on here that's about whistlers.

Even me being a guy got flirted with on there by another guy. It was strange and unexpected to say the least. Love it. Days progress, mobs respawn. Dont belive raids happen though Very sick, would look awesome in the middle of my base. Would be sick if you could make a guide. We hosting ours of a friends pc. But im assuming if its cloud based you can switch all the pcs off? Probably... I have yet, to accomplish this feat. Gratz man. I also have a the frost bomb, but a hughe fan of the playstyle. Busy making a coc icenova cyclone ele or barrage coc icespear/frostwave ele. Both look zoomy af Isnt this old school Runescape? Underrated comment Feels bad man, but its so true S+ with its foundation stacking is all he needs, been playing Kenshi this past few weeks as well so I tink i know what he means I too have been getting this more so than any other league . Because technically they are not allowed? Were is the sale link? That being said, you look like the girl my parents warned me about 😉 Um....yup. disgusting ... I want it Just stop the flirting for a while and just talk to him as normal if he flirts with you just smile and laugh don't saying anything flirty back. Till he stops flirting from his side, then you know he got the message. What also helps is talking about other guys you find cute or attractive in front of him, not necessarily to him but to his sister when he is around. Hell get the message soon enough. Oh no. I mean she is pretty fcking cute though. This is beautiful, im running the life version of this, but you made me consider the dark side. Where even is that? All im saying is that its fcken ugly. \n","2121 Please 😊 Help help help :) 😊 Thank you!!! 😊 \n","2122 I’m not interested if it’s gonna triple the price. Give me a credit amount.

Veigar- “Your demands tire me!”\n","\n","Miss Fortune- “Sure you can handle me, Summoner?”\n","\n","I’m sure there are more than those two that I’m forgetting, but that’s all I have off the top of my head I’m sorry if this is badly written. I don’t write well when it comes to raw emotion, but I needed to tell this story to someone and I’m embarrassed to mention it to anyone in my life right now. If it’s inconsistent or anyone has any questions, fire away I guess. It’s not like I can sleep well anyways. Know what mistakes shitty players make, exploit them constantly, get huge early leads, snowball that lead into making yourself unkillable. Pretty sure you’re all just getting baited by a troll. Don’t enable his antics, please. Just gives him more incentive to be an annoyance. Some bot shit probably Yeah his neighbor is a drug dealer or something so it’s not really surprising that the cops are there but 14 cars is a lot My vote would be for CIW. I live there currently and I really thought I’d hate it after a move from Dickinson, but it’s a surprisingly nice and fun community. Most people are quiet (minus Mohawk) and the social groups/opportunities can be a little small, but if you build a good rapport with your floor (especially as a transfer), you’ll have a great time. Plus the dining hall is a huge plus, the food is solid most of the time and it’s really close to all the buildings. Also helpful that the community is centered on campus, it’s about 5mins to LH and a little more to CW, plus less than a minute from the Union and Admissions (in case you need to go there for some reason). Do yourself a favor and avoid Oneida though. That building is a nightmare. Two words- exploding toilets. It’s a scam Yessir! Good to see you’re still collecting. Gek!! Glad to see you’re still on that Burnt Sienna grind. Hope you’re doing well my friend. Also this will be hella weird if you don’t remember me so I really hope you do lol CRL team made the finals :( Boo Stony Brook You can make that happen Mine’s at 2.00 and I think yours still looks faster, lol How are you air rolling so fast? Mine seem super sluggish compared to yours. The official Rocket League discord has a ton of people on at all times at all different ranks. You could start there. I don’t wanna say that Rumble is easy, but there’s a reason that a player like JonSandman can hold his own in a 1v1 against someone like Sizz if he has items on. It’s definitely easier in some ways, and I’m confident you can get the RNG Champion title. Pretty unusual I’d say If he’s more based on mechanics and you’re more based on rotation, it sounds like you should find a third in-between kind of guy (or third man for defense and demos) and play some threes.

WOOOOOOOOO! BUMPER CARS! No I did not, some random person did—I was as confused as you are lol Not funny, didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've wasted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt.

But you’re right about the food!!! I spent about 15 minutes today just squirting water into ONE HOLE!!! And I’m still not sure if I got all the freaking food out I’d wait at least 2 weeks. Every site I see says to wait 2 weeks to use a straw minimum and I’d say smoking is about the same. My aunt got dry socket from smoking after a week and she said dry socket is worse than the actual removal. New Englander here. It’s a losing battle. If she’s really covered I’ll take a slicker brush and try and brush as much of them out as I can then rub her down with a towel. She had a play date the other day and I had to end it early because she was covered in so many snowballs it was starting to hurt her when she ran... I then spent 1.5 hours brushing her and trying to melt some of the bigger ones with a blow dryer... my god it’s impossible. Not OP, but I’ve owned dogs that need regular grooming! Try and get your pup in every 8-10 weeks. They should be brushed with a [slicker brush](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TYENWY4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_W7CT43W1EFD3WJQWJRQC) these brushes are the best to get the little mats out. Doodle owners get a lot of crap because they don’t realize how often their coat needs to be taken care of. I brush my pup every other day and get her groomed about every 8 weeks. You can get them groomed with a “face, feet, and fanny” when they’re still young just so they can get used to it! The one we live in. She just took over the job about a month ago because the last president was a num nutt. We have new neighbors who have 4 outdoor cats. They’ve decided to use our yard as their hunting ground. I don’t know what to do. We used to have a great bird population (we have feeders because my dad adores watching the birds). But the cats are ruining it. On top of that they leave dead mice everywhere. I have a new puppy and I really don’t want her eating them, I’m getting sick of going outside every morning to make sure there’s no carnage. \n","\n","The new neighbors also have a stupid dog. It’s “free range”. We live in a neighborhood... dogs should not be free range. He’s a menace and poops in our lawn. I don’t know what to do. I also don’t know why I’m typing this, I think I just needed to vent. I loathe these people. His little wippies had me in tears. Truly the hero we didn’t know we needed Debatable. Burlington is “green peace” liberal while Portland is more hipster liberal. If that makes sense, Portland is more in your face. They’re both about as Blue as it gets It really is. It’s sad. Their stomach will literally flip so nothing can pass, it’s extremely painful and they’ll eventually lay down until they die. Owners will have to walk them in circles to keep them from lying down until the vet can come and see if they can be saved. It’s called colic FUN FACT: The NYPD has a 4 hour class that a certain group of officers has to take dedicated specificity on how to get metal cock rings off of someone’s dick Update: she has no managed THREE JUMPS on the couch. I need my dog mom card revoked... We now have the couches and chairs covered with boxes so she wont jump up... The first couple of nights for me was pretty much pure hell. My girl screamed her way through the night consistently. Don't give up though, crate training really is the best. I would take a little bowl of her kibble upstairs with us. I would lure her in with a treat and shut the door. She would wine and cry but when she would be quiet, even for a little bit I would giver her the praise \"Good quiet\" and drop a piece of kibble into her crate. I would keep doing this until I pretty much fell asleep or would get really long stretches of quiet.\n","\n","I also made sure her crate was facing me and put a blanket over the crate so she could only see out the front. I had a very dim nightlight on too so she could see. When it came to potty breaks I would only take her out when she was quiet and we would play the \"Good Quiet\" treat game again until we fell back asleep. It took a couple nights until it was very very minimal wining. \n","\n","She turned 6 months yesterday and sleeps like a champ for a good 12 hours in her crate overnight without a sound (besides the occasional puppy dreams!). The few sleepless nights are worth it in the long run. There were a few times I almost caved and just brought her in bed with me, power through it! Good luck! Have you tried Himalayan yak cheese chews? They keep my intense chewer satisfied for a couple days!  I think they should be safe for a 10 week old, but always do the research!\n","\n","As far as the harness, it looks good to make. Just make sure it’s not pinching him anywhere! Absolutely! Puppies are so exciting and such a joy! If he has been raised in a pen maybe have two crates, one in your bedroom and one in the room you spend the most time in. Set up the crate and buy a pen to put around the crate, if he’s used to that environment it’ll keep him feeling safe and comfortable. \n","\n","Also, for the ride home like others have said have him go potty before you get him in the car and he should be fine. He’s 10 weeks (2.5 months) and should be able to hold his bladder for 2.5 hours at minimum. If you want to make sure he doesn’t have an accident don’t give him any water till he gets home after his potty at home. Also, definitely go with the snuggle puppy. If I get a puppy again, I will 100% be investing in it. Going from cuddling with your litter mates to an unfamiliar crate can be very scary for a pup. I got no sleep my first two night and ended up sleeping on the floor with my puppy with my hand in her crate. Good luck! Hi! My pup got spayed yesterday and it went much better than expected. She’s an Aussie mix and very high energy. When she got home she was very drugged up and uncomfortable. Her surgery finished around 12:00 and I was told to pick her up at 6pm. If you have the option (the vet should do this anyways) always leave them for at least 5-6 hours at the vets to come out of the anesthesia and recover with limited movement. Ask them if they gave her pain medication before you pick her up and what they’re exactly sending her home with. Ask as many questions as you want!\n","\n","She slept through the night great and took her pain pills and ate a bit of kibble this morning. I got her lots of stimulating toys like antlers and chews and took away her balls and studies so she wouldn’t be tempted to play with them. She’s has jumped on the couch twice today and is causing me a great deal of stress but she’s honestly fine. Your girl will be too! Got my pup spayed yesterday. She been awake for an hour and already jumped on the couch.... it’s so hard! I just got my little girl spayed yesterday. When I brought her home she was very out of it. But now, after a good sleep and some breakfast she’s happily chewing her bone. If you don’t mind here’s a couple things I recommend that are helping me so far!\n","\n","I ditched the cone and got her a [Recovery Suit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JQ57WQG?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) it has helped her so much. She’s sleeping comfortably and it keeps her incision covered but it still gets air. \n","\n","I also put most of her toys away and got her stuff to mentally stimulate her. Right now she’s at my feet chewing on an antler to keep her busy. I also got her some bully sticks and another treat ball to stimulate her without getting her wound up and excited. Nonetheless, she has already managed to get out of eyesight and jump on the couch... we can’t all win. Good luck, your girl will be fine! This, if he is a small breed putting him in a box lined with the pee pad is a great idea. Many pups grow up in this type of environment and it may be beneficial. Put a couple toys in it with someone in the back seat with him. I also never tried this, but have heard wonderful things about it [Snuggle Puppy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BH5D7K3/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_IkfaGbHBDM9EP) I wish I had gotten this for my little girl for her first couple of nights.

She was playing with another puppy and a bigger dog came and ran full speed into her side knocking her across the yard. Poor little thing came home all sore. It was until the next day when I was trying to get her to go up the stairs and her entire back end seized up and she started crying out in pain. She’s doing so much better now! Thanks for this response! I actually get her groomed at the day care she was injured at (I know I know). I took my bichon there for all 16 years of her life and they’re great. It was a sporadic injury that could’ve happened anywhere and they’re a dream to work with. \n","\n","Her groom today actually resembles a sad old man so I kinda get it (I’ll link a photo)!

So volume 3 I believe  \n","2139 I believe that all of Austen's novels \"deserve a read\", but really, if you found you did not have the inclination for Pride & Prejudice, I wouldn't be surprised if the same held true for her other works. They might be something of an acquired taste. And, of course, there is only so much time, and so many other books, by other authors, to be read.... Maybe, but... it looks like GB Times' location is Finland.... And how would such a media outlet, if actually state-sponsored, NOT have the resources available to at least put on some pretense of being professional and serious? I would be astonished if a middle school journalism club released a story with infographics as pathetic as those in this piece.\n","\n","All this begs the question though what \"sources\" we are pushing to the front pages here.... I've read The Idiot and Notes From Underground, started and dropped Brothers Karamazov, and read The Shooting Party. To me, Dostoyevsky excels in his caricaturing of the liberal professional or career bureaucrat, and all the absurdity of certain of our institutions, just as Dickens does, while simultaneously managing a deeper, more meaningful penetration of the individual, and enabling us to see things from his view rather than just mock his foibles or eccentricities. Hey, spoilers! Even if, you know, this particular plot point is telegraphed ahead from the very outset. I've read probably seven or eight of Dickens's books and have decided to read through all of his main novels in the order that they were written, starting with Pickwick Papers. I read mostly in the morning before I start working and then again while eating lunch at my desk. I work in an open office sort of space, and more than a few times I have embarrassed myself by literally LOLing. I had never heard of the GB Timea before but ... the infographics they put together for this piece are laughably bad. I mean, in the second one you can clearly see the picture of Earth that they stuck on top of a picture of star-filled space. And what's up with calling the property of quantum entanglement \"spooky\"?! That cannot be a technical term. I can imagine. Like I said, it still tasted great even as a soup, but it would have been nice to have the texture there too.... What's up with the large number of grammatical and syntactic errors in this article? I WAS a little concerned about the fact that the recipe only got like, 3.5 stars. But I figured, it's Alton Brown, how could he possibly lead me astray. :\\ Will do. As an armchair ants and social insects enthusiast, I found your link's mention of the fact that these fellows are sometimes tended by ants especially fascinating. I knew that ants sometimes \"herd\" aphids for their honeydew, but would never have guessed the same held true for treehoppers like this one. As far as situations that you don't want to see on your plants go, that is one that I would really enjoy being able to observe. Thanks for the ID! Interesting to know. The plant is actually outside for the time being, so I just wound up flicking him off. I've been picking mine when they get to be three to four inches long, but maybe they could get longer? I dunno. I know what you mean though, with regards to impatience. I've only got a few plants, and none as productive as some belonging to the folks on here; in theory I'd like to let my Cayennes and Hot Portugals ripen from green to red, but I always wind up picking them before then. Plus, part of me thinks that the sooner I pick a fruit, the sooner the plant will again have enough energy to produce more.... yeah, that was my first thought as well, but then I remembered that I don't subscribe to any newspaper and I have like, 30 rolls of paper towels in the closet from Costco so.... My Hungarian Yellow Wax peppers do the same thing... really threw me for a loop the first time I noticed it. What are you doing with all of these guys? Salsas, raw in salads, pasta sauces, dehydrating for flakes... ? so true; as simple of a piece as it is, it's almost hard to believe it came from Ikea - one would have a hard time finding something of a similar quality there these days Oh, they did this in Contact (1997) starring Matthew McConaughey & Jodie Foster. Mahler's 8th is no doubt exciting, but I think that I am more looking forward to Ravel's complete Daphnis et Chloé and Brahms's Symphony No. 4 in the 2016-17 season. Actually, I have a set of the latter's symphonies performed by the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Abbado, recorded in the late 80s/early 90s. It will be interesting to note whether there is any agreement between the two Sounds. \n","2140 I agree with all of that, but we're kind of getting away from the actual point. The two commenters above my first comment were saying that the color changing skill is a sign of brain power and intelligence, and the comment I replied directly to questioned if the behavior is automatic with the implication (at least as I understood it) that an \"automatic\" behavior is not one that should be taken as an indicator of cognitive ability.\n","\n","If a behavior can be learned, regardless if it's taught by someone else or learned naturally, I would say it is an indicator of some level of cognitive ability, regardless if whether it eventually becomes something that's done without requiring conscious thought.\n","\n","On the other hand, I wouldn't consider the most basic survival instincts indicators of cognitive ability. So the implicit question then is whether or not a cephalopod's ability to change color is a skill that's developed or if it's something ingrained in their DNA from day 1 just to keep them alive. Yeah lemme guess. You were 20 something and he's more than twice your age?  Every job I've had at a company that's been around for a long time I've heard about all the things \"we used to\" do. Like company outings, tuition reimbursements, Christmas bonuses. And yeah, giving employees meaningful raises, never something they've said out loud, but nothing I've ever been given without a fight either. Is reading an automatic process? Do you look at every letter individually and piece them together into words? Or do you just read the words? Fermilab still has accelerators of various kinds. The Tevatron was a special kind of accelerator, a hadron collider, and it was shut down in part because the [LHC in Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider) basically made it obsolete.\n","\n","Right now I'm sitting about 20 miles away at [Argonne National Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonne_National_Laboratory), which is where a lot of the work for the Manhattan project was done, and has an array of its own accelerators as well I don't think so.  Harry talks about magic as the sort of primal force of nature, energy of life, etc etc etc. I think you have to have it flowing through you on a regular basis to have the side effect of significantly increased life span.  Charity might have the potential to wield some magic, but she isn't working the \"muscles\" needed to have that energy flowing through her.  \n","\n","\n","For example, I would expect the paranetters and similar minor talents who regularly practice to maybe get sick less often, be more likely to live into their late 90's, early 100s, etc.  But nothing you would consider super human.  \n","Someone like Hannah Ascher, who has significant talent in specific areas and uses it often might live well past the natural life span and heal from injuries quick enough to notice if you're paying attention, but not the several 100s of years we see from the senior council.    \n","Mort would probably be in the same boat.  He has significant talent, but has considered giving it up.  I wouldn't expect him to have much of these benefits if he does. This is going to be the lynch pin of whether or not it's \"useful\":\n","\n","> Scientific computing also seems like a dream job for me, though I've  heard that those kinds of jobs are few and far between and not as well  compensated as software engineering jobs. \n","\n","They aren't that rare.  I work in materials science R&D and wish I had more experience with scientific computing (/patience for it). I've definitely seen many jobs where it would be useful if not the whole point of the job, but on the other hand  I've got many friends from my physics program that ended up doing computing things that are completely un-related to their degree.  \n","The nice thing about programming/computing is that it's a skill that's pretty easy to demonstrate, so even if you don't have a CS degree, you can still show you know enough about it to get a job. But you will have to do a bit more of selling yourself.  \n","You're right that it's generally easier to find well paying work with a CS degree.\n","\n","Going the other way isn't as easy.  Trying to get a job in science without a significant background in a hard science is a much harder sell.  If it's really your \"dream job\" plus you seem to enjoy it, I'd stay stick with it if the work is manageable.  You may or may not end up using it in your ultimate career, but if you see a position you want in science, it will be hard to sell yourself without itl Before 2015 it did.  And that's why the industry term is \"Craft brewery\" rather than \"Microbrewery.\"  They can still have huge sales numbers and distribution ranges, they just have to be independently owned.  Lagunitas was only number 5 in terms of total volume in 2013. That happened pretty recently. They opened their Chicago brewery in 2014 when they were totally privately owned. Heineken bought 50% in 2015 and the other 50 in 2017.\n","\n","Not sure if/how much they expanded their distribution after that but they were already nationally distributed before heineken. I'm not saying you should teach Newtonian mechanics + gravity like you would in physics, I'm saying the approach Newton (and less talked about Galileo) takes of forming a broad theory based on measurements that then has the ability to make predictions is an important process in science.  \n","\n","Previously the popular explanation for the motion of the planets was that they must be circular because they're \"heavanly bodies\" and the heavens obviously follow the perfect shape which is a circle... Except we had direct observations showing they don't travel in perfect circles... Ok then, they have \"Epicycles\" which involve circles of various sizes stacked on top of each other to explain the difference.  It gets convoluted, but stacking epicycles can eventually produce an adequate description of the way the planets move.  \n","What it doesn't have, is any reasoning behind it to say why they follow these epicycles, and by extension, no ability to predict what would happen if we were to discover planets further out than Saturn (Uranus and Neptune weren't known at the time).  How many epicycles would it take, how would we know? \n","\n","Compare that to Galileo and Newton, who not only give relatively simple rules that all the planets follow, but also the ability to predict things that they don't already describe.\n","\n","This sort of idea becomes important when talking about consciousness.  The idea of dualism comes up; it's a description of consciousness being something that exists outside of physical explanation. Because the phenomenon of consciousness is so complex and difficult to define,  it's tempting to believe because people like to think we're special. But it is basically a super natural explanation with zero good reasoning behind it and doesn't have the ability to explain anything outside of itself. Which hilariously, appears to be hooked up to an electric motor, backwards, working as a dynamo to power a single LED. That's probably because Holmes was his polar opposite in many ways.  Holmes is a hyper empiricist while Doyle attended seances and refused to believe that Houdini didn't have supernatural powers even while Houdini explained illusion to his face.  \n","\n","\n","This is compounded by the fact that Holmes wasn't just famous after Doyle's death.  The character was so popular even in Doyle's lifetime, that he was basically forced to retconn the death scene he wrote and keep writing more Holmes stories. Post has been removed by the mods now... Probably for rule 2.  Though I would invite you to post over in /r/PhilosophyofScience as this post would fit right in, though I would suggest you modify your premise a bit.  \n","Again to point 1,  Your whole premise is that you're trying to simulate human consciousness.  So your reasoning that we have to simulate every particle down to subatomic/quantum accuracy because we don't know what will happen if something is different is self defeating.  You had better figure it out, because you're going to be simulating it.  \n","\n","\n","I'll again say, a better premise for needing to simulate every atom down to that level is the Star Trek transporter.  We see a person beamed from point a to b, and they are not only in the same position, but have the same stream of consciousness.  We often see those transported without prior warning shaking off the disorientation caused by this. Then, you have fun related question, not just how much data does it take, but what sort of data rates does it take to process?  We're moving every atom over the course of maybe 5 seconds, how long would that take to process with the current computing power of the whole world? This was definitely the most interesting topic covered in University Philosophy of Physics in my opinion. Some of the best questions stem from Sci-fi, which is good because it makes it easy to access, find examples, and likely that students will have some vague introduction to the ideas.\n","The Matrix and Data from Star Trek TNG are my favorite examples. Not sure how familiar high school kids are these days with those two though.\n","\n","That being said, I do think some of the more historical questions about things like epicycles vs newtonian gravity are important to address first. Especially for high school students they need to first be able to critically examine the differences in the ways we accept things to be true. I'll be honest. I didn't continue reading in depth after this:\n",">The first thing to decide is what information to store and what to discard. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that no piece of information is truly irrelevant and therefore every single bit of information needs to be stored as far down as the subatomic level. \n","\n","This is a huge assumption and you give no real justification for insisting on this.  The hand wave to schroedinger's cat has zero bearing to the relevance of storing human consciousness.  There's no reason to believe that an electron in your toe being in a different energy state would make you into a different person... You need to make a really strong argument if that's what you're claiming.\n","\n","But even if we did accept that, you never mention anything about compression.  If we're already in the realm of sci fi technology why not speculate and talk about how they would actually accomplish that?  The vast majority of the atoms in our body are Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen.  Most of the hydrogen and oxygen are in water. How would you simplify the analysis to let you save huge amounts of data?\n","\n","If anything, your assumptions lend themselves closer to Star Trek transporters than the couple of examples you give. And the conclusion you end with is really only vaguely interesting if the original question was something like, how big would a black hole be if you suddenly turned in to one. Is that different from the Melon? I don't think the joke works when it's an actual panther and not just a large house cat. The scene in Dead Beat, Dresden describes Morgan specifically not lingering too long on either Mac or himself. Ah the 1250's what a decade that was!  Crazy times. The joke is obvious enough I don't think it needs a \"reveal\".  But yes that's Ghost Story ch 20 >This does not change the fact that it's possible for math problems to have only one solution. \n"," \n","Anyone who understands basic algebra knows this is false...\n","\n","> The writing on the page can be assumed to be read with the knowledge of a particular language, in a base 10 number system, and with a certain understanding of the abstraction of mathematics up to that age/grade.\n","\n","We're talking about starting with kindergartners, who really shouldn't be assumed to have any knowledge of the abstractions or formalities of math.  And, as you move up the grades, if the emphasis is on simply getting the answers correct, and not on understanding why the mistakes they make are wrong, the assumption that they understand the abstractions necessary to do higher level math is a bad one.\n","\n","Though your reference to my base 4 example is misrepresenting the point I was actually making... More on that further down\n","\n",">The abstraction itself is difficult to understand and needs to be taught in math class, and many students will need more help when their answers get marked wrong, because it's confusing... If a student from a different culture enters the school and it's their first exposure to some of the abstraction, they will need to be taught the abstraction.\n","\n","This is the argument I am making, with the addition that teachers need to actually be able to be aware that this needs to occur, rather than simply mark answers wrong.\n","\n",">This does not mean, at the K-12 level, students need to be aware of, for example, alternative number systems, besides binary in some cases. \n","\n","Though again, your throwback in the middle to my base 4 example is misrepresenting the point I was making with it. It's just an example of why you shouldn't simply mark an answer as wrong without explaining why or without understanding the assumptions you make as to why your answer is \"correct\". I'm not saying we need to start teaching math in other bases to middle schoolers, nor am I saying teachers should expect students to have learned math in other bases. Though I would say it is useful to introduce the idea of other base systems than base 10.\n","\n","Your further reference to binary is arbitrary and a bad argument when you're saying they don't need to even be aware of other base systems.  Binary is impossible to understand without understanding the basics of how to convert between bases which would include covering arbitrary base systems.  \n","\n","Assuming the inference of binary was to computers though, binary is pretty much useless to anybody who isn't trying to build an operating system from the ground up or doing forensic data recovery. Not exactly K-12 subjects, so binary is no more useful to learn about than any other base system.\n","\n","As for the rest of it, it wasn't really relevant to the argument I made above but a different culture does not necessarily mean a different country. A white kid raised by two upper middle class parents and a nanny is going to have a totally different life than a black kid raised by a single mother trying to stay out of poverty, even if they both live in the same city.  Including cultural history is a way for kids who feel like they have nothing to gain from math, who are more likely to fall in the latter category or other similar circumstances, to hopefully understand that it is useful and meaningful.\n","\n","Here's A reasonably selected quote from the education week article that emphasizes the purpose.\n","\n",">When too many black and Latino students see no place for themselves in math and science, Castro-Gill said, it’s important to be explicit about how their own cultures contribute to math and how they can use it to make their communities, and the world, better.\n","\n","Your particular choice of quote is an obvious example of a straw man that is used for either left wing propagandizing or right wing fear mongering... Too tempting indeed Lets be honest, just because he wouldn't have the same reason to burn the place down doesn't mean it's not going to end up burned down...  \n","\n","\n","But seriously, the excuse the vampires had to not treat her like a guest was that she forged an invite.  If she instead doesn't go at all or Dresden willingly lets her come along, while I don't doubt that shit would still go down, there is a decent chance that she gets out fully human. For certain definitions of the word \"profit\" What about if instead she stayed home and was very glad she didn't go to that party where a bunch of people got poisoned and her potential date burned the place to the ground? You'll never know how glad I am someone actually got that joke. You're not making any argument at all here.  The question is what should those math classes look like?  Should you just mark all incorrect answers with a red x and jackhammer in the correct answers as rote?  Or should you consider that an answer might be incorrect because of a particular way of thinking and explain why its wrong?  \n","\n","\n","Doing the former isn't actually teaching math at all, doing the latter makes it much easier to teach math. \n","2141 Government organizations don't have  right to religion.

It depends what you're looking for. 2 story runs and 1 clear of the survival mode is probably where most people will stop.\n","\n","The combat is clearly inspired by DMC (especially Dante) but due to level and combat encounter design the game is simply too easy to have that degree of replayability. The combat itself is quite good but there are just too few enemies and they have too little health to give a DMC level of combo satisfaction. \n","\n","You should be expecting to play this fan service game for its Riders and not its combat. If you enjoy seeing the rider's finishers in glorious slowmo with their theme in the background many times over, this will have infinite replay value. I will replay this after plat just because I love W so much. 12 hours of the story when letting all the cutscenes play out.\n","\n","In order to plat you need to play at least a second time to get enough resources to max everyone and craft everything. Second playthrough is lightning fast and it even has a timer encouraging you to go fast.\n","\n","There's also a pretty meh survival mode tacked on that can be completed in 30 minutes. The reward basically gives you hax.\n","\n","Total playtime with plat in mind probably 15-18 hours, which is pretty short. Enjoyed every single moment tho. Kuuga and Ichigo. But they paid $60/80/100/their entire livelihood for this game! The devs must now eternally serve them as their personal assistant and respond to their every whim on the spot!

I was actually in the exact same position as you, due to the negativity at launch I didn't get the game and missed the chance until PS+ due to other releases. Following Genesis' PS4 release I went back to play 3.\n","\n","I would say Fury really is unbearable to me at the beginning too, I was quite disappointed initial feeling \"oh man, have to put up with this a whole game?\", especially after having played War and Death in previous games. That changed as I progressed the game and I definitely feel Fury's development makes her even more interesting than War by the end.\n","\n","Combat is quite different and I would recommend using classic mode because it allows you to use healing instantly and cancel your animations with dodge. As you progress further you will gain a ranged weapon which allows you to separate enemies into smaller packs and engaging them on your own terms. \n","\n","In earlier areas, the enemies who can block you are fewer in number and you can quickly eliminate the fodder ones by holding square to spin attack, and use L2 to target the actual tough enemy to dodge and counter.\n","\n","Early on you want to put as much points in strength as you can. Shortening combat encounters by dealing more damage is easier than getting a bit of health that can't save you even from an extra hit. Later on you will also get items that gives you passive percentage health boost and continuous regeneration, thus damage should come first in my opinion.\n","\n","In terms of length the game is roughly 15 hours for me, where I beat each boss with 3 or less attempts on balance. What is worse is the enemy just dips back into the zone and heal up all the damage they've done. This is actually how things work in most sizable companies. Getting something to change (like some procedure improvement or policy update) takes a minimum of 6 months assuming no politics is involved. The larger the company the more silly it is to get things moving if at all. It's no surprise game development would be similar. Was post-journey Gilgamesh not also a candidate or did he say that only as a joke? (the whole I use bunch of mystic codes to qualify as a caster deal)\n","\n","As someone just playing through LB2 now I don't quite recall Merlin officially defaulting into the title? It's actually interesting that in the Chinese version we just take the kanji 極地 and it's basically \"Extreme Environment Use Chaldea Uniform\", has nothing specific about Artic.\n","\n","https://i.imgur.com/8OdYBSW.jpg\n","\n","The description is \"Allows movement in extreme environments\", with no association to cold. I don't know if the wiki is the official English translation but \"Artic Region\" seems very specific. Although the way it is introduced in the story does seem very context specific to be protecting you from extreme cold. The shadow border crew does mention you are wearing a coat on top of it though. Actually in mhw mashing doesn't reduce stun duration.\n","\n","Video: https://youtu.be/-DDQMDY_hdg They don't, each player should run a different note set. Generally speaking at most you'd want 2 HH because there aren't that many offensive songs. By the 3rd HH on you'd be looking at healing on demand songs and whatnot, which is slower than chugging a potion. Unless we're talking about very specific encounters where you'd want Teostra's note set or whatnot. From the 6 months I've played E7 when it first came out I can say that the roster is largely catered to male players, with male character releases very far between. The ratio of a new male character was around 1 per 3 or 4 female characters.\n","\n","Comparatively to FGO E7 also doesn't have a lot of interaction with the characters you own, so the sense of attachment is also lower. The equivalent of bond in that game only changes their menu expression (not even battle portrait), no new lines or anything, and also no interaction between the characters you own (e.g. Hector throwing rocks as Achilles is a personal favorite). The only characterization comes from their limited dialogue in events.\n","\n","This is made worse by the gameplay that encourages you to roll the new characters due to newly introduced boss or stage mechanics that often works against the old roster. So having a huge pool of characters and low attachment greatly reduces personal investment on the characters. Hence is why I suspect they have to rapid fire waifus to pander to their main demographic, which generally is less sentimental and \"switches waifu every season\". The Chinese hunting community literally calls it the buttplug because the official translated name uses Chinese characters that are very rarely used and hard to type.\n","\n","When we talk about GL strats it usually does start with \"first you insert the buttplug\", yes. False. In the original myth he was very clearly a male. He is frequently referred to by titles with \"太子\"(prince) in life and also after his resurrection. This is even stated in the servant profile.\n","\n","The genderbend is a Fate thing and it is explained in the profile section unlocked after clearing the interlude.

This is a good article amongst for any occasional management. \n","2174 I feel like others have already hit on this point already, but I think that you made the right choice overall.  You need to play to your outs, and either choice that you have available to you requires intervention from another player to stop you from losing.  At a cEDH table, most players will not intervene to stop someone else from losing but will intervene to stop themselves from losing - anyone with meaningful interaction will not use it to save you but will use it to save themselves from a combo kill.  You made the choice which gives the greatest chance at you being victorious, which is what is expected at a cEDH table.  \n","\n","\n","Commenting on the politics point, while politics doesn't often come up in cEDH (since the playstyle is supposed to be less feeling based and more information based), discussions and deals can absolutely come up (particularly with cards like Zur's Weirding or Telepathy).  In cases like these, all you're doing with your \"politics\" is discussing new information which would not normally be available in an average game, and this situation seems to fall into that category.  There's nothing wrong with laying it out there that you only have one piece of interaction and two lethal threats facing you down.  Then at that point, the rest of the table has to act accordingly.  The other player is faced with a choice - either take a deal with you and don't lose or decline the deal and lose.  Since \"play to win\" is the expected mindset at this table and everyone knows this, you can use this as leverage in your discussion - your only way to win is to get help from someone else, so you are putting them in the position where their only way to win is to give you said help. Yes, unless the card specifically says \"basic forest\" (such as Nissa's Pilgrimage), you can find any forest subtype card.  It's one of the reasons why fetch lands like Misty Rainforest are played. One route that I was toying around with was using creature lands and \\[\\[Umbral Mantle\\]\\]. \\[\\[Inkmoth Nexus\\]\\] and \\[\\[Blinkmoth Nexus\\]\\] in particular, if you're not too heavy into colors.  You can only take out one person at a time normally, but it's a fun idea. Great, thank you both for your help! So basically, since leaving the battlefield is part of any \"death\" trigger and the creature did not satisfy the counter requirement at the begining of the \"death,\" the trigger would not happen even if the creature would satisfy the requirement at the resolution of the trigger? I forgot to reply earlier, but thank you both! Thanks for all of the feedback!  \n","\n","\n","I was toying with whether or not to run the bicycle lands, and I ended up putting them in to have additional targets for my fetch lands if I don't need them to come in untapped that turn.  Since I'm playing some pain lands though, mana confluence and city of brass do make sense.  I'll need to tinker around a bit with each.  \n","\n","\n","Yeah, comet storm is the mana sink.  I figured that since I could tutor it with spellseeker it would be a solid choice, and if I need to I can use it as spot removal in a pinch (which I can't do with something like torment of hailfire).  If I end up getting the blooodline combo off though, I can just use Inalla to 7 people to death, so IDK if I even need it.  \n","\n","\n","Grim tutor probably is a better fit than long term plans.  I figured that since I have sensei top I could cheat things out if needed from third down, but grim tutor is just better overall.  I forgot that card existed, thanks!  \n","\n","\n","Tormenting voice (and I've considered cathartic reunion as well) are there mainly to fuel the delve cards with help from fetch lands and to get cards out of my hand and into the graveyard.  That's also why I run aethermage - since both of my finishers are wizards, I can dump them from my hand.  Ideally, I want this to be as all in on a quick reanimator combo kill as possible, and I couldn't think of many ways to actually get my cards into the graveyard without voice/reunion effects.  I'll probably end up putting careful study in, but I don't know if I want to take those cards out.  Trinket is there mainly for value, and trophy is there to get the altars.  Solemn I could cut, and mistbind can do some similar loop shenanigans like wanderwine and championing itself with its clone.  Niv miz parrun doesn't seem quite like what I want to be doing, but nezzy and sire are interesting ideas - they can add a weird level of protection and discard outlet that could work to my advantage.  Aethermage is a card that I've enjoyed having as a backup/toolbox card.  snapcaster, spellseeker, and trophy mage are the usual one's I grab depending on what I need at that point in time. TIL careful study is a card.  Thanks! Looks like I'm on the right track, thanks! Thanks.  Would you happen to have the email address perchance?

You can set Scythe then pop it on their turn by tagging out into sliprider, basically a poor man's dimensional barrier that can become a rank 5 on your turn Have you considered cat of ill omen (and possibly super nimble mega hamster) to search it out?

I demand a refund.\n","\n","Also, 125 First off, I would definitely try to fit in reasoning, it's crazy good in this deck.  Also, I like the metalfoes fusion, I do something similar with a set of volcanic shells.  I would also consider throwing in a soul charge.  \n","\n","I run a more turbo, all or nothing version of the deck so I go a bit heavier on spells (triple field spell, terraforming, brilliant fusion, and instant fusion) but I run summoner monks to cut some of the dead draws and also run star drawing with it - you can get it off of monk then use it to complete a 4 or 5 and get an extra card off of it. There's a Fire King list somewhere that works really well - both field spells blow up from the hand, so with terraforming you almost never brick I'd appreciate the link too please Basically, what is your deck designed to do?  For example, the win condition of ABCs is to get out your fusion fatty ASAP and use its effects with union hanger to prevent your opponent from doing anything and pulling ahead in board advantage with R4NK spam.  Mermail Atlanteans, on the other hand, are designed to explode all at once and OTK from an empty board.  Red Eyes don't exactly have an identity of something that they do exclusively well.  Other decks have better board control, stronger and more reliable boss monsters, etc.  Basically, anything that Red Eyes can do a) another deck can do more reliably or b) isn't really worth doing to begin with. Sent a private message about this. Are there any restrictions on when Crimson Knight Vampire Bram can activate its effect?  The card doesn't specify.  I had a raidraptor on the field and Cattle Call and Phantom Knight rank-up on the field against an ABC player.  If he tagged out his ABC buster for the components during my end step, could I cattle call my RR into a force strix, use PK rank up to get Bram, and then use Bram to steal ABC buster from their grave? \n","2175 Named our cat Taco because Tacocat is a palindrome.

Thus, I had no access to a computer for most of that time, it is only the last 5 years or so that I have moved away and am establishing my life alone. I have never used Reddit or anything like it before in my entire life. So, I apologise if my incapabilities to work out how to post photos on a brad new -to me- web page at first makes you doubt my credibility or honesty.

They could be close to suicide and your nasty comment or put down or picking on them or whatever negative thing you decode to let come out of your mouth or actions could literally be the final thing to push them over the edge.. you may not ever know it or find out but that guy at the supermarket who you pushed in front of for being slow and called him a name to express your annoyance might have just lost his wife to cancer and has little to no will to live and BAM he goes home and hangs himself...

But with each person you meet, try and get a feel for how they interact with the rest of the group and subtely mirror their behaviour. For example, if there's a loud party bro trying to pump everyone up for an activity, try and mimic his enthusiasm. Or if there is a shy person who stays quiet and reserved, try and approach them in a calm but polite manner to not over stimulate the interaction. \n","\n","Just overall, be polite, try not to complain, and do your best to show that your fun loving person and the rest of the group will eventually see that and be more open to making a new friend. It depends a lot on the shelter. I work at a shelter and we also run a detox program in a different part of the building. The detox clients receive three full meals prepared by several full time chefs. I partake in the meal plan and eat there for almost every meal of the week. Of course I pay for the meals. But whatever doesn't get eaten by detox clients is given to those staying on the shelter floor. The meals prepared are almost always top quality. For example, butter chicken with coconut ricee and Greek salad, along with some type of pie or cake for desert.\n","\n","Typically if there's no leftovers from detox, shelter clients will get those cheap noodle packets or very simple sandwiches. \n","2188 Speaking as food service worker, $15 is entirely too much. I work for a university, so I do get paid over minimum wage (by very little), but DAMN - $15! I may work my ass off serving over 1,000 customers in a single shift, and I might feel like a deserve a million dollars sometimes, but almost any minimum paying job in food services is completely mindless. To me, it's almost as if minimum wage was created for food service workers, because honestly... I can't think of a single profession that has it easier. Yes, fast food workers should get paid a little more, but $15? They're entitled idiots. I completely understand a cop's perspective when it comes to any situation because no matter what the call, I know things can turn unpredictable and dangerous incredibly fast. However, I feel it is very important to assess the level of threat before using the most powerful weapon one has, even when it comes to police. I've heard of ammo that is, at the very least, \"less\" lethal, but still has the ability to stop someone who is considered a threat. Seems like that's a viable option, but no one ever hears much about it. I guess my question is, how do you even know your life is in imminent danger? Having a gun handy, that's useful, I guess. However, I took a legal studies class last semester, and at the very least, in civil court, you have to be able to prove the person attacking you was a reasonable threat. For example, let's pretend I'm a 6 foot tall man weighing in at 300 pounds. One day, I'm walking down the street and a 5' 2\" woman runs at me flailing her arms and attacking me. If I have a gun on hand and I shoot her would I be at fault? Technically, according to my legal professor, a reasonable person (assuming the physical information provided) would still be found guilty of shooting this woman, at least in a civil court, even if they claimed they \"felt\" like their life was in danger. I'm not sure if this is just a civil court thing, based on state law/federal law... Not sure? \n","2189 Yeah, bit of a head scratcher this post.  Every credit card tracks all your transactions, and programs like Mint or YNAB can consolidate all that information across multiple accounts.  Also, transferring money from a bank to a credit card website is dead simple.  A credit union isn't doing anything unique here. Yeah, and its important to remember that its not always the \"aggressor\" that can escalate things into violence.  You didn't do anything wrong obviously, but its not crazy to imagine that that one individual could feel threatened enough to \"defend themselves\".\n","\n","I have to sometimes remind myself that having to find another parking spot, or waiting a bit longer to merge into traffic, is effecting literally just a minute of my life.  Not worth the blood pressure. So coming from living in LA and Chicago for a while, I vaguely remember this being an issue there too.  You just don't know the other person's current mental stage, or how easily they turn it up to 11.\n","\n","It was years ago I was merging onto 75 right before 20 and the car in the furthest right lane (this was during rush hour traffic so everyone was moving slowly) wouldn't let me in.  I put my hand up in disgust when he past me and the passenger got out of his car and threatened me out in the open.  It was definitely a \"WTF\" moment.  Nothing happened beyond that, but instances like this get me thinking about, \"What if those passengers were just a little bit more angry.\" Anyone have a good company they would recommend for installing a french drain (or just improving my current yard drainage)?  The previous homeowner buried the downspouts and just ended them in the soil.  Took years to figure it why we also had minor water flooding in the backyard.\n","\n","The two previous quotes I got they were more interested in redoing my grass and mulch, but I can handle that myself. Seconded, my family is only 12 payments away from finishing.  Been a huge financial help to date. Search PLSF.  You take out the loans (federal), graduate from a university (can't be for-profit), and work a qualifying job for ten straight years.  Careers include, but aren't limited to, government positions, law enforcement, public health (from nurses to doctors), public education (not a for-profit private school), law (public interest, ie prosecution or public defense), and even library services.\n","\n","The \"payoff\", you pay a percentage of your income each month based on your salary for ten years than the government nullifies the remainder (interest included) after 120 payments.  One nice added perk, which won't affect you unfortunately, is payments have been zero since last Spring and still count towards the 120.\n","\n","A good portion of these careers become high income earners after ten years, so that's an added plus.\n","\n","If you really want to go for broke, join the military, have them pay for your undergraduate degree, get a law degree (or some equivalent), go back into the military as an officer, and then you can have the government pay off your law degree loans. When I picked mine up from Target it was already bagged (oversized Target bag) and all the PS5's...there were around a dozen plus...where in a metal cage when a lock.  Crazy that they are just sitting out in the open like that. Probably Thingiverse then, as it was posted in 2015.\n","\n","FYI, those with a 3D printer, searching \"apple watch\" this charging stand is one of the top results.  Some commenters have noted that it doesn't fit the latest 44mm Series 6. Which came first, this being sold on Amazon or the 3D file available on Thingaverse?\n","\n","The reason I ask is that this is the first time I've seen it for sale, I've known about the .stl file for years. Unrelated note, looks like Gamestop nicely packaged everything.  My Target box looked like it had been through hell.  Thankfully the PS5 is fine, but I was nervous when I got it. I disagreed with \"If you don't think it's worth the money after that\".\n","\n","$12 a month is bargain for the the full featured app, automatically add transactions, and the AI logic to auto populate reoccurring transactions.\n","\n","The main reason I also disagreed is that YNAB doesn't start to show its true full potential until after a year (give or take) of usage.  It'll take you 4-6 months just to correct the bad budgeting mistakes you've been making.  YNAB has allowed me to master my budget so well that in the event if either myself or my wife lost a job we could continue living without any budget constraints. Agree, and also completely [respectfully] disagree.\n","\n","I've been using YNAB for a decade, and I think the paid version is completely worth the cost.  Not having to manually add (or download and upload) transactions is a huge time saver.  Their app is also fantastic for on-the-go budgeting.\n","\n","I can't speak highly enough for YNAB, it completely changed our finances. Location does matter, it matters a lot, and if you live in a metro area it's pretty easy to get a PS5 as of March.  For example, there roughly 20 Targets within a 30-45 minute drive from me and 18 Best Buys within roughly that same distance.  Just my opinion, but I'd pay close attention to Target and Best Buy since they are local pickup.  When Target dropped last week I had seven minutes [after the tweets went out regarding stock] to pick out a store to buy a PS5.  I actually had enough time to go back to my cart and change my store since I changed my mind on where I wanted to pick it up on my way home. I would never trust anyone online that's not directly selling through a website with buyer protections.  Reddit and Twitter offer no such protections.  It doesn't help that this user has only one post.\n","\n","I actually have two PS5's right now.  I ordered the Costco bundle Monday but it sat in \"Order Received\" all week, and then on Thursday I just happen to time the Target drop by pure coincidence (I was on Target buying a air purifier).  Ordered and picked it up two hours later.  I tried to cancel my Costco order but at around the same time it shipped.\n","\n","Reason for this post, because I'd never trust the whole, \"I have an extra\" or \"I decided to go with Xbox\" posts.  I'm returning the Costco bundle because I don't want an extra controller or 1 month PS Plus subscription.  Why would anyone go through the hassle of selling something for retail when they could, like me, just return it. I imagine the individuals saying, \"Just avoid hitting the curbs\" live in more rural areas and have never tried parking in a city...especially an older city.\n","\n","The curbs, solid granite by the way, are about as straight as my redneck uncle's teeth.  Sure, I could park further from the curb, but then I'd risk some joker flying down a residential road at 45+ mph knocking my mirror off.  Don't even get me started on my front and back bumpers.\n","\n","Older streets also don't have gutters to act as a buffer.  They go asphalt straight to jagged-edge granite. Good list, a few pointers I'd add:\n","\n","* If you want to keep the tweets to just posts about drops, turn off \"retweets\" for the individuals you follow.\n","* Don't follow a dozen accounts, I haven't seen any evidence that would suggest this would be advantageous.  They will all post updates in the same general 15-30 second window.  This was more of a problem in December (early January) where bots were still making good money, but since March it's been less of an issue.\n","* Use the Container extension for Firefox.  I'll be honest, this pretty much guarantees you'll score one when Playstation Direct queues up as long as they have a good amount of stock.  I was able to score several for friends and family this way.\n","* If you live in a major city, Target and Best Buy will be your best bets.  I got one for a friend's birthday yesterday off Target and I literally had five minutes to pick out which store I wanted to pick it up at.  I kid you not, I even decided at the last second to change the store, went all the way back, again through checkout, and still got one with a two-hour pick-up.  If you don't live in a highly populated area Target and Best Buy will be more challenging.\n","* If you really...really...want a PS5, Gamestop and Antonline would be my go-to's to monitor.  They both offer expensive bundles, but with PS5's barely selling for $150 over list (taxes not included) I think scalpers are mostly avoiding bundles at this point.\n","\n","I missed every drop for a solid four months and got incredibly frustrated.  I even started to check Facebook Marketplace.  This month I have been able to get a Costco Bundle and Gamestop Bundle (both going to friends who will pay me back).  I've hit Playstation Direct several times, and Target twice.  Today is the first day I stopped tracking the PS5 as all my friends, family, and myself have one.  Getting a 3080, now that's a different story. I fully expect the scalper market to plummet by the end of the month.  It's down to almost $650 which is barely a $100 over MSRP after taxes.  Heck, looking at StockX, at $650 you're barely making any profit after all the fees. To everyone still searching, keep at it, its getting surprisingly easy to score a PS5 this month.  I got one from Costco on Monday, but was able to get one from Target this morning five minutes after it was posted.  Before anyone asks, I cancelled my Costco one (still sitting in \"Order Received\") because I'd rather not have to buy a bundle.\n","\n","It looks like stores are getting in big shipments, and my understanding is Amazon might have the biggest to date very soon. That's typical for Wells Fargo and BoA.  Major banks have had terrible interest rates for ages. Not my intention to sound cruel.\n","\n","I just don't see any reason to buy from a scalper or reseller right now.  Last month, maybe if you were desperate.  But in the last two weeks it has gotten a lot easier to score one with only moderate effort. Does it matter?\n","\n","I don't know if you've noticed, but retailers have been doing some large drops lately.  Walmart was almost four hours long, Gamestop had a ton of bundles a few weeks ago, and Best Buy has been pretty consistent.  Heck, even Costco has had large drops.  I saw a few accounts this morning saying that the rumor is Amazon is going to have their largest release to date pretty soon.\n","\n","Just be patient and follow some twitter accounts that post drops.  I scored one pretty easily this week.  There is no reason to pay scalpers even $50 over list. Also, why are you adding \"before tax\"?  It's a scalper, they aren't reporting this sale as income for a business; you don't pay a sales tax.  If a seller ever asks you to pay taxes above their list price laugh in their face. I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of having the cord.  I recently got the Quest 2 and have been using Virtual Desktop to \"stream\" games from my PC to my headset.  It's a true gamechanger.  My internet is good enough that I don't notice a difference at all between going over wifi or the USB-C link cable. I only play on easy mode.  With Last of Us 2 I not only played on easy mode but I also turned on a bunch of options to make it even easier.  Looking back, the part of that game I hated the most was the last boss fight (the basement one).  I hated how hard it was and I also just gave up.\n","\n","For me, I care about the story and collecting/upgrading, that's it.  I've never been a fan of difficult combat, and its the reason I loathe FPS games that cater exclusively to fast pace gameplay.  I remember liking older COD games that rewarded stealth.  But that's just me. I keep seeing this \"resale argument\", but I'll be honest, and I've owned most consoles to date, the only time I ever resold my games was when I was also selling my system.  At that point I was basically just giving the games away at bargain bin prices.  I rarely ever play games the day they come out, and the digital games go on sale all the time.\n","\n","I switched to buying all my games digitally a few years ago and I've never looked back.

However, in practice, this is only viable if everyone else cuts their “mess” making to 0 while the developed countries are cleaning up. This has been the biggest real argument throughout all this. It’s unfair to tell the US to clean up while we specifically allow and even subsidize other countries who are adding to the “mess.” Yea, they definitely could have done better with the redesign. I promise they spend more than that. It’s just hidden under other departments and budget items. Let’s just say I have some insight into what far more conservative universities are spending and 25 million is a bargain. The essence of warfare is misdirection ... “Propaganda.” Well, that does tend to be what marxists call history or really anything contrary to their official narrative. It’s amazing to me that people didn’t know that this sort of thing is happening in China and not just to the Uigurs. They’re a community country. Not only have they been engaging in these sorts of things since Mao won their civil war but it’s what Marxist governments have always done. If you go back through history, Marxist governments make the Nazi’s look tame. It’s just what that ideology does in practice. We’ll see. I certainly hope so but it’s also worth remembering that they have to be able to get past a veto for the next 4 years.\n","\n","One of the things that has really bothered me about Republican congressmen in particular is that they’ve got all these things they want to do and act like lions when they’re in the minority and then they get the majority, have the power, and they go back to spending like it’s daddy’s money and their first time in the mall with daddy’s credit and we don’t see any sign of all these other great ideas. It’s like that direct tv commercial only with majority and minority republicans. Couldn’t agree more. I suppose it’s possible but I’ll believe that when I see it. This sort of thing should be remembered but I’m forced to ask how precisely the Republicans plan to accomplish that ... If you pay attention the internal polling data is probably some of the best out there. But they don’t actually share that for a variety of tactical and strategic reasons. It’s why I tend to perk up and pay attention when I hear something about that internal data. That said, you should always take polling data with a grain of salt. In this case that result makes a lot of sense though. Respectfully, the only time anyone uses that phrase in real life is to justify something bad. The many don’t get to run roughshod over the few just because they are “many.” Numerically, that isn’t even necessarily accurate anyway. The reality is that city dwellers in the major cities mostly like this but anyone outside those cities mostly doesn’t. The actual numbers that works out and what constitutes a “need” are all debatable. They’re Republican Party surveys for in house use. The only reason I know they exist is I talk to the right the people and someone mentioned it. Then again, hard to be 100% sure given that level of hearsay but it adds up when you think about it. The project doesn’t benefit and likely hurts every little town in between on top of resulting in eminent domain takings for a huge number of folks. It’s not about that - it’s about the folks in between the cities not wanting it and it’s no wonder - this sort of thing serves to take their land and take business away from their communities. Putting stops in that would fix that and make it worth it would only defeat the purpose of high speed rail. Guys, this isn’t happening. Look at the position of the state congressmen for the relevant areas. They all have surveys from their area that make it real clear that they won’t be re-elected if this happens. Dallas likes it. Houston likes it. San Antonio and Austin like it. No where in between likes it. Amen. This is the obnoxious part about this coverage. Extortion is bad but so is what he’s accused of doing. Why? Most judges would allow that because refusing it would probably give rise to a legitimate basis for appeal.

One-eared muppet A Scanner Darkly with Keanu, Woody and Robert  So she get's caught dissin the Chinese official the other day and now she's getting a story for winning a fuckin tesco gift card. I swear someone's running an experiment right now just to see how the Queen's people react. Smug face the other day and now she looks over the fuckin moon. But God Save the Queen, amirite?? Give those Chinese officials that gift card your fuckin highness.  Mmmm hehe Man I fucking love how weird you are and I mean that in the nicest way possible <3 I can hold my own with a guitar, just playing improvised chord progressions. However, the way I strum the chords changes every couple of bars. I may decide to throw some quick \"twiddly bits\" in, but only if I can get the timing correct as to keep the rhythm constant. The way I change the strumming up allows you to essentially hear different sounds coming from the chords. You may \"half strum\" the likes of Em, and then pluck the G, B and E strings. There are so many combinations of partial strumming and plucking. Just get the funk with it and find a friend to improvise little solos as you play. Also I make layered improvised tracks when I'm at home, just with audacity. They're not great but I'm learning. Here's my favourite one https://www.soundcloud.com/furrfexache/ussgg Hey man, thanks for the compliment. Its a bit sloppy here and there but I rush my improvisations. This one took an hour. I think I need to take my time more. Django Reinhardt has been my focus lately ;) minor swing is ab pretty jiggy tune ;) Here you dude. It's pretty basic but free. It's really good when you figure out a few tricks ;) http://audacityteam.org/ I used audacity to record different layers and my microphone is a blue snowball. It's not great but I'm just working with what I have until I can get a better mic. I usually just play along to any song in general, be it any genre. I just try to match the key and tempo and that's how I'm learning by ear. I do have a liking for classical music though ;) Cheers man, I'm happy you liked it :) I love that song so my answer is = y 100% Ohhh yes indeed Even still, I really appreciate who's here nonetheless ;) Thank you so much. I'm not finished just yet though, I still have a way to go. I've broken myself down and now have to rebuild, so to speak ;) I actually agree with you. It seems as though I'm pressuring myself into getting surgery when in reality it's cheating nature out of running it's course. I might give it an extra month or two, but at the moment it's not a pretty sight. If it looks promising I'll scratch that idea and roll with it. In fact for the time being, surgery is plan B. Thanks for the advice man. Thankin you kindly my friend ;) although I do miss that shaggy hair :P Ahhh man that touched my damn heart hahaha. We may just be randoms on the internet, but you are the type of random we need more of ;) I don't want to come across as someone cocky, because I rectified a problem with myself that should have never been there in the first place. I don't really take pride in that, but I do feel a weight has literally been lifted from my shoulders haha ;) Seriously I am humbled by that comment <3  My plan was kind of messy, it didn't require a lot of change in diet. Say if I drank 6 litres of Coke a week, I cut that back to 1 litre. I stick to around 1500 calories a day and just eat chicken, fish or pizza haha. There's still room for junk food, just don't overdo it.\n","\n","I stopped taking sugar in my tea and switched to black coffee. 2 days a week I would fast and only drink water, and every day I would go for a mile walk and listen to some music on the way.\n","I recently gave up smoking as well because it was impairing my walks quite a bit. Say if you've eaten more than you should one day, walk an extra mile to make up for it.\n","\n","The best tip I can give you though, is don't do it to look good, do it to feel good. That's key for maintaining motivation. Do it so you increase your life expectancy and let that be what drives you. To live longer. It feels great to be able to run up stairs without losing your breath. \n","\n","It might not be the best diet or exercise plan, but it works for me and I hope this helps. Also thanks ;) This is too much to handle. Everyone here is so nice. I miss the long hair but shorter hair is much more efficient ;) Thank you so much.  Cheers brother. I'm hoping that I can join the Irish army soon enough. I wouldn't have been able to last year. Ah man you're too kind. Thank you for the compliment. Using anaesthetic to knock me out and then letting scalpels do the work ;) I think it's some form of gastric bypass surgery but the only thing I'm worried about is wearing those damn hospital gowns (With the open back hahaha) for 4 to 5 days straight. And thanks man, the pics dont show just how bad I actually was.   This. Sitting in front of a machine made from different materials, formulating thoughts and broadcasting them through an invisible network and having another human receive those thoughts on their end.

We didn't see a lot of him last year though he started figuring into the rotation later in the season. He's more of a 4-5 tech in the 3-4 or End in the 4-3 when compared to guys like Jenkins and Benito who are purely build for inside line play. I think the jury's still out on Strowbridge. The coaches seem to like him and I noticed a couple of big run stops when he did get on the field where it was like the runner hit a wall when he tackled them. Will probably add a DE in the draft but he figures to be in the rotation mix depending on his progress. He's a project player. Depth, Space eater. Solid pro. Thought he did enough in his previous stint to stick around. Also good to know that Grier isn't completely allergic to adding older vets if the fit is right. Interior D line looks set for the coming season with Wilkins, Davis, Butler. Expect Benito Jones to either slide to the PS or beat out Jenkins for that last roster spot. Ted's a good dude but nah, we good. It's just a flesh wound. Different style of RB than Gaskin and Ahmed. Brown will run you over. I'm all for those three and a rookie. Excellent. I imagined it would be more than that. Sweet. Happy with that. Hello Goal line snaps mostly. Reported as eligible a number of times in that situation. I think overall it's more to do with PFF being an imperfect system for grading rather than any particular vendetta. I've lost count of the amount of times I've seen someone clearly have a good game, not just for my own team yet he's been graded poorly by whatever arbitrary measure that they use. I suppose I said they always lowball ours as those are the grades I pay attention to the most when I see them posted. I try to avoid PFF more often than not but it's so prevailing when discussing players these days that it can be quite difficult to do so. I feel there is value there but only when used along with other metrics. Not as a stand alone \"this says X so player was good/bad/average\" sort of thing. PFF always lowball our grades if that helps. Godchaux is a decent player and a good guy to have around. Money is a little high for him but that's free agency for you. I'd have bailed at $6m per. $8m is an overpay especially for our needs at the position. Great guy and happy for him and good luck but he can go fuck himself on gameday. Posted yesterday bud. Honestly they deserved that if for no other reason than they've clearly recognised that we have a problem on that side and we've done absolutely fuck all about it. Holy shit hahahaha It's poorly worded but I think the point OP is trying to get to is that Chelsea can overtake Arsenal in the all time Premier league points table this weekend if results go their way. Not a bad performance from anyone today. Professional job against a very physical side. Smart by Højbjerg. Stops the attack and gets himself a night off Good job Davies Disagree with the commentator there. Tanguy has had the shit kicked out of him all game. 2-0 up he doesn't need to take any more of it. Top performance again from Ndombele. Lamela MotM so far I thought Hernandez was alright? Woah. That's a huge surprise. I wasn't the biggest fan of his play last year overall but I didn't see that coming. Definitely got to have a plan in mind for free agency and the draft with a move like that. \n","7963 And you're right - independent contractors don't get paid vacation days. Was it right of me to have it written on the contract?\n","\n","I feel like my relationship with the CEO is a little sour now, how should I approach this? Should I tell her how I felt about entire discussion and some of the comments made by the CFO? I have an update for everyone... Sure, that'd be great but if you want to. I hope sharing this will also allow you to express any negative feelings you have built up. It's always good to talk it out. How was it like meeting another guy? Did you meet someone during your separation (before divorce)? If so, how well did the guy take it? I realized that and because I love him and he treated me well at the same time that I guess I was blinded by it. It really hurts when I finally realized what I've been through and the emotional tolls it taxed me. Sometimes, I'm still in denial that it won't be as bad because we're seeing a counselor and he finally realizes that his actions are truly hurting me and the consequences he's facing is me wanting to divorce with with him. I'm assuming you two were married and you left. How was your grievance process like? Did you ever think that you two could work it out through counselling and that he would change for the better? The problem is that we love each other but rarely when we argue he would be abusive. Majority of the time, we can argue and communicate fine. Wow, that's extreme! Were you able to prove yourself innocence? Were you married with your spouse? If so, how did you stay on track with your separation process? Did you miss him/her at all during the separation process? I do forgive him after each argument. We would talk and hug it out. Shortly after the abusive event occurs, he would express remorse or guilt and wants to apologize and swears, \"It will never happen again\". However, with the beginning of another abuse episode, I would feel angry, disrespected or treated poorly in some way and the cycle starts all over again. The abuse is repetitive and predictable, it is also intermittent, and the rest of the relationship might be perceived as good enough or even loving. I think I'm conditioned to think our relationship is loving and caring when we're not arguing but when it gets ugly then I get flashbacks of the past abuse and regrets being with him.  I finally had the courage to open up to him about how I feel but I'm afraid that I'm too hurt to give him another chance to fix our relationship. On the other hand, I'm scared to make that leap of faith and leave. I'm scared that during the grievance process that I will miss him and wants to get back with him. Were you ever in a relationship where your spouse was verbally and physically abusive (shoveling/kicking/punching) at some point in the relationship and you 'wanted' to leave but decided to stick around and see if he/she will change for the better? How's that life right now?

I travel to the US frequently (from New Zealand) and sometimes when I'm just passing through briefly I don't bother to get travel insurance. A couple of years ago I was staying with a friend and sliced my finger with a knife while washing up. We walked to the nearest ER and after a couple of hours I had 4 shiny new stitches. While the doctor was working on me I asked her how much this would cost and she said she had no idea, and seemed annoyed that I would ask her. I found her response amusing, and figured it would be expensive, maybe $200, but brushed it off since it was my own fault for not having travel insurance that time. A couple of weeks later after I left the US my friend got my bill in the mail for close to $1000! They had detailed each suture and swab and doctor-minutes-used precisely on the bill with a charge for each - $100 per suture if I recall correctly. It was the most absurd bill I've ever seen. I since found out that, if it had been daytime, I could have gotten in a taxi to one of the local community health centers and been fixed up for $50.\n","\n","To compare? I was in the Netherlands last year and came down quickly with some kind of unknown illness. I was sent to various doctors and labs for the day including emergency oncology, who were all extremely caring and kind. Total cost: 90 euro including medication that cleared me up in a day or two. I payed that 90 euro with the greatest of pleasure.\n","\n","Since then I always get travel insurance to go through the US, even if I'm just there for a few days for around NZ$150 a month. That's about US$85 for full care of non-pre-existing conditions plus repatriation. It's ridiculous that travel insurance is cheaper than permanent care for it's own citizens.\n","\n","(edit, clarification of residence) \n","7973 Maybe it's the shredded chicken consistency?

I think we could do it for about $40 including insurance.  That is first class through USPS.  Priority would cost about $50 plus cost of insurance which might vary depending on exactly where you are.  If you're okay with that and you understand that the difference in shipping cost will be added on top of your bid if you win, then please by all means, go ahead and bid! Thanks! yes, for sure.  I am going to try to make one for everyone who wants one.  I hadn't anticipated this kind of interest in this piece but I had a great time making it and love how it turned out, *despite* the 50+ downvotes ;)  It will be my pleasure to make some more.

Being alone is shitty, but it's *far* superior to keeping abusive people in your life. Make your escape plan. If you stay with your brother, do that, otherwise just focus on finding a way to get out as soon as you can. I have abusive parents too. I don't speak to them anymore because of it. I'm so much happier. Sometimes I do feel sad, and feel almost like I betrayed them.

The second thing I did is throw a towel over the mirror. That didn’t cover the entire mirror, so after that I ran out of the bathroom and slammed the door behind me.\n","\n","Then I googled it.\n","\n","Down down down the rabbit hole I went. First a few news reports here and there, mostly click-baity tabloid-like sites. Then the blogs. Right when I was starting to think that I had imagined it, I stumbled upon the subreddit. Then there was no turning back. Tab after surreal and horrifying tab piled up in my phones browser. \n","\n","By the time I emerged it was four in the morning, it hurt to keep my eyes open, and I was still sitting on the floor in my bedroom wearing nothing but a towel from my shower. \n","\n","I dropped my phone on the floor and crawled under the covers to settle into a fitful, restless sleep.\n","\n","When I woke up the next morning, It was almost easy to convince myself it had all been a bad dream. If it wasn’t for the towel over the mirror when I went to pee before leaving the house. I decided I could hold it for my 40 minute bus ride.\n","\n","By the time the workday was done, I had very nearly forgotten the whole business. But there the towel was over my mirror. I considered a lot of options. I could go out, stay at a friends house maybe? I decided it was time to stop being ridiculous and face the thing.\n","\n","I stepped into my bathroom and just looked at the towel for a few moments. After a handful of deep breaths, I removed the towel. \n","\n","My own reflection looked back at me. \n","\n","Allegedly.\n","\n","I just stared at myself for a long moment. Really actually looking at myself, eyes wide, looking for imagined discrepancies. I started scanning the room through the mirror, soaking in as many details as I could, comparing it’s bathroom against my own. \n","\n","Then I saw it. Down in the bottom corner of the mirror, tucked behind the trash can down near the toilet. A small smooth grey stone existed down there in the mirror image. I checked behind my trash can. No stone. I double checked the mirror. Now that I could see the stone it was so obvious. A discrepancy that screamed out to me and made the whole mirror image look wrong and fake. Taking a deep breath, I tried to remember what the subreddit had taught me. I reached towards the mirror, not looking at myself, but keeping my eyes locked on the stone. I didn’t tear my eyes away, even as my fingers gently touched the glass, and my mirror fingers did not come to meet them on the other side. Every part of me wanted to look over at my reflection, to see what my mirror self was doing if it wasn’t mirroring me, but I didn’t. I knew it was imperative that I didn’t. I was in too deep now. I had to push though. I pressed more of my fingers against the glass, then my whole hand, without my mirror hand on the other side it looked like my hand pressed against a window into a bathroom just like mine. I kept applying a steady pressure until I felt the glass give. It flexed inward like plastic wrap, warping around my hand, suddenly taking on an almost gooey viscosity. Then with a snap it broke. I felt it like electricity up my arm and heard it like a zap. And then there was no resistance. Only empty space into the other bathroom.\n","\n","At that moment a very nearly slipped up and looked around the room. Thank god I did not. I stood there still for a moment while I refocused myself. I breathed in and out, in and out, eyes glued to the stone still, my arm still in the air, not daring to bring it down lest I distract myself from the stone. Once I felt in control again, I slowly climbed up onto the counter, and crept though the opening where my mirror had been. Ever so slowly I felt my way across the other counter and down onto the other floor. Never taking my eyes off the little rock tucked under the other trash can. I became acutely aware that something was watching me- my double. I could hear them breathing. Quick ragged pants, like they had just gone for a run. I resisted the urge to turn and look. I kept focused on the stone. I stooped down, peeking behind the trash can. Up close I could see that it was perfectly smooth and perfectly grey. It didn’t have even the slightest blemish. I reached towards it, but then I stopped.\n","\n","I could feel their breath on the back of my neck. They were right behind me. I stayed perfectly still, focusing on my breathing. I winked one eye, then the other, keeping my eyes transfixed on the stone. Feeling their breathing panting hot against my neck, heavy and labored, as if in pain. I lurched forward and grabbed the stone.\n","\n","I pulled it close to my chest. I looked at nothing else but the stone clutched in my palms. Why did I even come here? What did I hope to gain? I could feel their breath on my neck still. Then I felt something touch my shoulder. I yelped and dropped the stone. Screaming, I dove towards the floor, scrambling after it, the stone rolling oblongly away, fumbling against my grasping fingers. It rolled into the darkness behind the toilet and I crawled after it. I felt their fingers digging into my shoulders, dragging me back. I threw my arms around the toilet, sobbing and clinging the slippery porcelain desperately. I stone was right there in the back corner. I could just reach if it I let go of the toilet. I grasped franticly with one had, screaming and reaching with everything I had. The other me screamed too, a bloodthirsty howl as they gave one last yank and pulled me away from the toilet and away from the stone, dragging me across the floor and towards the bathroom door. I shut my eyes and tears squeezed past my tightly pressed lids.\n","\n","Then it was gone. Nobody was dragging me anymore. I lay there for a time, and then slowly opened my eyes. I was back in \\*my\\* bathroom. The mirror was back. The other me was gone. With trepidation I crept towards the toilet, and reluctantly l peered behind. \n","\n","In the shadows behind my toilet sat a small perfectly smooth perfectly grey stone.   “I was at home, watching “Bird box” on my TV, eating a quart of ice cream.” The bad cop frowns suspiciously, like he has a sour candy stuck in his mouth and he doesn’t want to spit it out on a dare. The good cop frowns even more suspiciously, and furiously scrawls some somethings on his writing pad. They frown at each other. \n","\n","“Can I go now?”\n","\n","“Only after we are through with our questions you degenerate scum!” The good cops howls. The Bad cop fumes silently, looking like he is ready to punch me in the throat. I am unphased. This kind of thing happens every week. I sit calmly in the cold metal chair and stare up at the ceiling of the interrogation room. When this first started happening I insisted on a lawyer before I answered any of their questions. Now I just try to answer as honestly as I can and it usually goes faster that way. They get more and more furious every time. \n","\n","The two cops confer for a moment in hot angry whispers. \n","\n","“You’re free to go.” The good cop says. “But I wouldn’t leave town if I were you!”\n","\n","“Don’t leave town again. That is.” The bad cops says again.\n","\n","“Allegedly.” I counter.\n","\n","“Allegedly…” The good cop hisses.\n","\n","The whole mess only cost me five hours of my time. This is still disappointing, because it makes me late for bed on a weeknight. I get back to my apartment and the door is still ajar. I don’t even lock it anymore because I got tired of the SWAT team breaking it down. Usually they break the knob anyways. I close it behind me and prop a chair against the door to keep the wind from blowing it open. My house is a mess from investigators looking for evidence. They always have a warrant—somehow. They never find any evidence. \n","\n","I step around the piles of clothes and scattered books on my way to the bathroom. I floss and then brush, before changing and settling down for bed. I probably have another week before such incident occurs again, and I’m glad to have it over with.\n","\n","This has been happening for three years now, ever since I did one of those clinical trials for a sleep drug that was supposed to help people with advanced insomnia. I don’t even have insomnia, but they didn’t care when I told them and then promised to give me 8 million bucks to be in the study. I signed up for the cash reward, sure, but I figured it would be a hundred or maybe two hundred. The pill didn’t affect me in any way. I did the sensible thing and tied the 8 million up in trusts and investments. I make enough off the trusts to live a modest existence. I work as a store clerk anyways because I like the regular schedule and regular interaction with people. It keeps me grounded. I lay my head on the pillow and close my eyes, ready to put this day behind me and get up in the morning for my shift at the grocery store.\n","\n",".\n","\n",".\n","\n",".\n","\n","I wake up. Its time to plan the next heist.\n","\n","When I said earlier that I tied up all the money in trusts and investments, I was being truthful. Both in the sense that when I invested in these companies, they were legitimate businesses. I only infiltrated and co-opted them to be shell companies for my plans after the fact. I was also being truthful in the sense that the other half of myself doesn’t know anything about my second life as the worlds most infamous and brilliant criminal mastermind.\n","\n","How do I get away with it? Money mostly. Once you have money and power its easy to figure out ways to keep it. I always make sure that by the time my other half wakes up, I have an unbreakable alibi in place. But before I can get there, I have to plant the seeds for my next job. I’m currently cruising above the ocean at about 200 feet, my super sonic jet is flying under the radar. Soon the plane begins to decelerate. The VTOL jets kick in and the back opens, there is nothing but black empty ocean all around me and cold brilliant starts above. I jump out and land in the freezing pacific water. My target tonight is a secret Chinese military base under the sea- they are collecting something here I need for my next job.\n","\n","I dive down into the midnight blue ocean water. A HUD on my scuba mask guides me towards my target, and soon I can see the faint white glimmer of the undersea installation. There is no need to be subtle with my approach, they are relying on their radar to warn of intruders. A single plane dropping a single assailant with no way back out is not a threat they planned for. \n","\n","I go first for the big-dome like tent lit from within with a welcoming light. When I reach it, I swim to the enclosed walkway connecting this dome to the rest of the compound. I pull my cutter from my belt, and an angry spark bursts to life at its tip. With this against the metal surface of the walkway, I cut a hole in the walkway wall in ten minutes. The walkway collapses inward, the hall within flooding with water in a few short seconds. There is an airlock to the dome. I press the button to cycle the lock. \n","\n","Lights strobe and the heavy metal door begins to slowly creak open. A harpoon flashes past me.\n","\n","I turn, three guards in scuba gear are waiting in the hall behind. It seems they suspected my visit Afterall. I suppose being the world's most infamous criminal mastermind has its downsides.\n","\n","The three guards push off the walls and lunge towards me with knives all at once. We tussle. I make quick work of them regardless. All three guards are drifting lifeless in the water before the airlock finishes opening. That’s how fights usually go anyway. Quick bursts of violence that are ended brutally and quickly. \n","\n","I step inside the dome. Its dry inside as expected. A crystalline mound sits in the center surrounded by mining equipment. I step forward and shave a few delicate blue-green crystals into a container I brought for the purpose. I cut my way out of the tent. My boat arrives to pick me up right on schedule. I return to my bed before the sun rises and my other self arrives to prepare for his shift at the grocery store. “I had a lot of questions, naturally. My first question was, ‘where are the rest of my Potato Chips.’. Which is why I am here.”\n","\n","I gripped the man’s throat tighter with my skeletal hand. He gurgled pathetically, wide terrified eyes locked with my dry empty sockets.\n","\n","“So… where did they go?”\n","\n","“Glurrrrggg.”\n","\n","“Oh right.”\n","\n","I released his throat and he collapsed to the ground in a shivering lump. He cough and spat, and I tried to wait patiently. I needed to find the rest of the chips from the sweepstakes before they were consumed. \n","\n","“I’m just as confused as you are.” The man finally spat. He rolled upright, leaning back against his desk unbuttoning the top button of his neatly pressed shirt.\n","\n","“Are you though?” I give him what I hope to be a disbelieving stare with my empty sockets, and he shivers again. \n","\n","“Look. I don’t know what’s going on- things have been all fucked up around here since the new CEO took over. They started having seances at the shareholder meetings. Then the top managers started to act funny, like not themselves-”\n","\n","“I don’t really care about any of that. My soul is tied to the chips I won in the sweepstakes- and now I need to know where the rest of the chips in the lifetime supply went.”\n","\n","“I don’t know where they went.”\n","\n","“Well I need you to find out, and I need you to find out fast.” I pause. “Or I’ll make you pay.” They words feel uncomfortable coming out of my mouth. I don’t usually threaten people. But the circumstances are desperate. My life is on the line after all—after a fashion. And besides, I’m a monster already. \n","\n","“The man slowly rises on trembling knees, and then settles himself uneasily at his computer. The amber glow from the cracked and coffee stained CRT is the only light in the room and casts his sweat stained face in an eerie glow. He punches at his keyboard for some time, and I lean over his shoulder, trying to make sense of the columns of numbers and dates and maze of obscure directories and commands. After some fifteen minutes pass, he leans back in his chair.\n","\n","“I don’t get it. I found a lot for the sweepstakes, but there is only one pallet on the lot. A pallet of one bag. That’s gotta be some kind of test lot someone made at some point, or a glitch of some kind. But I can’t find any other lots that aren’t part of an existing distributor order.”\n","\n","“What does that mean?” I ask.\n","\n","The man looks over his shoulder and then flinches. I catch my reflection in the monitor’s screen. My skeletal face in the dim electric glow stares hauntingly back at me. feels strange to associate that face with my own. I lift my hand and the skeletons hand lifts too. I turn back to the warehouse manager.\n","\n","“Somebody must have deleted the lot for the sweepstakes in all the confusion after the contest.”\n","\n","“Ok. But where would the chips have gone?”\n","\n","“Anywhere. They probably just gave one pallet to every shipment going out that day until they were gone. The distributor wouldn’t complain about getting an extra pallet for free.”\n","\n","“This is an unfortunate turn of events.” I growl. The manager just sits awkwardly, tense, staring at his screen, waiting for me to leave.\n","\n","“I need you me to print me the records for every shipment that has left this warehouse since the sweepstakes.”\n","\n","The manager opens his mouth to object, but then set to work busily at his computer.

Think of the worst possible thing that could happen to your protagonist. Something you aren't even sure they could escape unscathed.

Keep throwing the worst possible setbacks you can imagine at your protagonist and dont stop until December To get a job in the computer industry you need to have three things \n","\n","\n","1) The technical skills. A formal degree is by no means necessary to get these. You can get them from bootcamps or free online courses if you are especially self-disciplined to use them every day.\n","\n","\n","2) A professional network. Most jobs come from people you know. Going to school can give you the opportunity to meet and work with other students, and interact with students in clubs. Get to know the upper clansmen. That way when you graduate you have friends already working. If you dont go the school route, meetups can be a good way to meet others in a industry. Meetup.com is a great place to start. You won't find anyone who will give you a job right away, but if you make friends over time, it can give you a  wide network of people who would recommend you to their boss 6 months later. \n","\n","\n","3) Proof of your technical skills and ability to be a good coworker. A degree does this a little, but what employers really like to see is projects-- especially ones you collaborate on. If you do school projects, document them. Let yourself explore and have fun tinkering on different projects you find interesting, this will serve as a flag to interviewers about the kinds of things you like working on. But also make sure you have the discipline to finish some of them. \n","Work with others when you can. Employers usually value a team player over a smarter candidate who is a jerk.\n","\n","\n","Gambling everything on an all or nothing 6 week binge could work. But I wouldn't recommend it.

What accent is this?  I would recomend reading r/Embedded (Embedded Software) and r/ECE  if your interest is more in the computer hardware and software systems increasingly used in vehicles.  Here's the thing about pervasive surveillance networks:\n","\n","Even if you have sensors everywhere, you need a way to parse all the data they collect for the information you want. You need people or computer systems to sort through it all for keywords, suspicious patterns, and what-have-you. \n","\n","Take network security for example. You would think you can just just run an AI on a server cluster to collect all the data on the network, and pick \"malicious\" patterns out of the stream.\n","\n","Turns out that's a pretty expensive proposition. Collecting and temporarily storing copies of all the packets traveling across an even medium sized network takes fairly expensive hardware. \n","\n","To process it, contemporary experimental AI systems usually struggle to crunch the data fast enough for the results to be useful.  \n","\n","Furthermore, if your collectors fail to catch part of the network traffic, the math your AI uses gets skewed since it only has a subset of the data.\n","\n","Now, these are all technical challenges you could theoretically solve with more money, research, hardware, ect. But they are all failings you could play with in your fictional dystopian setting. \n","\n","\n","\n","TLDR: A ubiquitous surveillance network would likely be large, expensive, complicated, and riddled with bugs and failures your protagonists could exploit. \n","\n","Source: Computer Engineering student who just finished an AI Network Security research paper.  Until a bad patch breaks their firmware, then you become one of \"The corrupted ones\".  That's because laws are algorithms for civilization.  Stevp and greenflash's point was that research shows  even when someone is told a news price they believed is fake, it doesn't often dissuade them. In many instances, they entrench in their opinion more. \n","\n","My personal, non-professional explanation is that the average person makes decisions for emotional reasons, and then justifies the decision with logic. I used to work in sales. First thing I learned: get the customer excited to buy, then provide them with logical reasons it's a good idea.\n","\n","The same algorithm applies to news. When someone is shown evidence a story they believed, was actually false, they have a negative emotional reaction (people don't like being told they are wrong), and then create logical sounding reasons to justify their emotional response. \n","\n","TLDR: People decide the fact-checking organization is untrustworthy, or the incident was a fluke, or any other number of reasonable sounding excuses to protect their own ego. \n","\n","Hence the argument for blocking fake news from distribution in the first place.  I agree with you. But I would like to point out that implementing a system that prevents fake stories from being published (or quickly \"unpublishes\" them, you get the idea), is censorship.

I guess the the quality of the picture (not good lol) makes it look kind of weird.  Thank you very much! If you think you are an artist, then you are. I wouldn't care if you could only paint stick figures, if you yourself thinks you are, then you are IMO.  I agree. The second fish looks great! Usually lots of contrast can be your best friend with watercolor.  Thanks everyone. I ended up making a few changes that added a little more dimension to the hair. I just felt like it was kind of bland...I appreciate all the input! This is my first attempt at semi-realistic hair. All criticism is welcome! I used liquid masking for the ultra highlighted areas. Let me know what you think! :-) Will do! Thank you! I use either hot or medium heat (either is fine) you just don't want to get too close with it. Give it a good 2 feet so you have some good dry air that's not too powerful. Should dry it up within a minute. It will actually help flatten then paper if it has started to deform as well. Hope this helps! :-) In this painting, the darker areas are a mixture of reds, browns and some orange. The lighter skin tones have more red and orange, but are very watered down. It all just depends on the lighting of the template. This was a very low-light situation. Hope that helps! Thanks! :-) The one thing I learned with watercolor, contrast is your best friend! Also, don't get discouraged. My paintings look like crap until the very end. It's only when I start to add my finishing touches like shadows and other small details that make it pop and look realistic. Let the white paper be your highlights! Definitely a hair dryer. My watercolors dry within a couple of minutes, but it could be the dry climate that I live in as well Thank you! I'll have to do that.  Great idea!! I'll have to do that.  Good work! It reminds me of Logan canyon. I live in Logan! :-) Also, I still do need to add the finishing touches like whiskers and what not... Thanks a lot!

While I agree that one of the cards (not sure which one) in Patron Warrior should be nerfed, I picked Shredder solely because it really reduces the viability of other 4-drops in this game.  Listen to any of these card reviews, read people's comments...every 4-drop is compared to it, and pretty much everyone falls short.  While the Patron cards are insane and annoying, Shredder, I fell, most greatly reduces the diversity of decks in this game. I hurried to comment on this one, mind dizzy with possibilities.  But I came here to find anything I could've has said had been said.  Look no further than this diverse, buzzing comment section...I feel like this could be one of the most versatile cards in the game.  Well don't blame me, he roped me into this! My thoughts exactly, and within a clip of my two favorite Muppets' characters???  Bravo, bravo Alright, just as I thought.  Time to spend a bit.  Thanks for the quick responses everyone!   Yeah, I get your point.  But then you're limited in your design by how much mana the card should be.  I guess though that with enough Demons coming in future expansions, maybe that becomes trivial. See, here's why I'm not a huge fan of the card now for the class.  Yes, it's a major buff and will be really fun to play.  But doesn't it really limit future demon design choices moving forward?  Malganis, for instance is an insane draw.  Would they have made that card if Bane was in it's current state?\n","\n","So they'll constantly be working their demon designs around keeping this card under control.

Least of all those FtT transgender chicks No it's masc guys who think the world resolves around them. Always acting as if they are some kind of poor, marginalized, underrepresented group in the gay community, when the whole entire gay world caters to them and treats them as the ideal. I'm kind of glad. Roll on the autumn, says this pup Transgender ideology is cancer Most of them are repulsive autogynephilles It's not transphobic for a gay to not want date an FtM, or for a lesbian to not want to date an MtF. A real homosexual is attracted exclusively to people of the same BIOLOGICAL sex. Gender identity is bullshit, all that matters is physical sex and you cannot change your sex. I think the transborg in general is pretty fucking fascist How I am a transphobe for not believing in your gender identities? Not believing in something doesn't make me \"-phobic\" of anything. If I don't believe in God, does that make me a Christianphobe? The fact is, biologically you are female, and probably aesthetically to as so few of you actually pass.  That has been disproved. There was a study of 1400 people's brains and there was no difference found between male and female brains.  Well then you are bisexual. If you're born with a vagina, and ovaris, you're female. Females are defined by their biological sex organs. Likewise, a homosexual is someone attracted to the same biological sex.\n","\n","Why am I transphobic for not believing a trans person can magically become the other sex by following those stereotypes?

Look through r/transpassing and see how often \"grow your hair longer\", \"wear some makeup\", \"get your eyebrows thinner\" etc. comes up. How else could they try and \"blend\" in as women other than copying their stereotypical presentation to a tee? Feminine gay men are not like that, MtTs thrive off gender stereotypes,  Look up the definition of homosexual then get back to us But it's accurate though. These chicks think that they can somehow become male by cutting their hair, changing their wardrobe and calling themselves \"Caleb\". They aren't men and that's just a fact.

It's just ridiculous that people can put nearly 600 hours into a hero then decide after 15 minutes of a new patch they're done :s  You haven't touched him since the update but you have such a  clear idea whats wrong with him... almost as if you should put time into him before you write him off :s \n"," * this is a new season, there a new metas making roadhog less viable to pick regardless\n","\n","* he shouldn't be able to succeed against a good dive team because, you guessed it, everyone saying he has no mobility is right! he has no mobility he has a long cd on his self heal and wait for it! he's the size of a house! \n","\n","* his time to shine has been the last 3 seasons especially season 3 when we saw a huge increase and focus on deathballs, just because the meta is shifting away from one hero you either learn to play them better or just move on. \n","\n","* I have played roadhog and I think he's fine.

Especially in this game, but if you actually enjoy Hog and not his gimmick oneshot bullshit then sure play him, otherwise keep complaining.  I'm just saying the only interaction we have with our rank is the SR system, so to put a filler in place that literally means nothing and all true measures of skill being done by the MMR just makes SR pointless. So what if you're diamond? if diamond for you is 3100 then sure you can get stuck in 2800..\n","\n","it just doesn't make sense. SR should scale similarly to MMR, not as fast and loose as it is now.  it shouldnt be 500sr difference though.  why have an SR system if nearly the entire SR of a rank means nothing? Seems pointless.\n","\n","500sr between gold and plat, plat and diamond, diamond and masters. 3/5ths of that is... unreasonable to assume that skill should fluctuate in that time? of course not, it's a broken system  thats 3 players having to work together to get the same result one person in CSGO could get. I get your point but it's just a completely different game and can't be painted with the same brush  Tbh this is the most applicable theory to 'Elo Hell' I've heard for this game. It really makes sense that false security in the skill of others would reinforce beliefs like that.  ....and you expected this thread to suddenly stop that? :s I don't think anyone was that naive. It's just a common theory in every competitive game and should always be discussed from both ends. Not just people being given the ultimatum 'git gud scrub'  It's an absolute shame because so many of my teams will be playing well but then because they're not seeing immediate results or we lose a team fight it throws them on tilt and then it sparks off a chain reaction of everyone getting tilted. I've been completely dominated by Hanzos and I've stood still for a day and never been hit by one, it's really (no pun intended) hit and miss with how someone is playing but once people put their.. opinion out there, as soon as it's ignored or disagreed with it's basically ww3. Fingers crossed I climb back to plat this season and regardless of everything, don't see people getting shouted at for picking anything.  Queue with me at 20xxsr, let's see how you feel about this thread after a day of that. \n","\n","I can guarantee you out of 10 games at least 2 will start with someone being so angry with someone else picking a hero they don't like/they're dps and they dont want to give it up so shout at the other dps to change/just generally toxic as hell because of the team comp. I don't think I've had a game in season 5 where I've not had to mute/block someone because they were becoming abusive for some petty reason.  The issue is you can't compare games, the state of those games and the state of those ranks. Whilst the system might 'eventually' let you climb or not, this whole idea 'you need 300 games to find your real rank' is, fankly, bullshit. People can lose and gain 500sr in a night without any concern from the player base. In all the competitive games I have played with a ranking system, (league, world of warcraft pvp, csgo, starcraft) never have I experienced such volatility in ladders and I have never seen people be able to shoot such drastic extremes to gain a whole rank or lose a whole rank worth of rating in one session. \n","\n","On top of that this game is balanced around giving people a fair 50/50 but there are so many players in a team your ability to tip those scales can and will be numerous times outweighed by the collective mistakes of the group. \n","\n","CS:GO allows you to oneshot headshot every single person and clear a round just by playing smart. There is no situation where outside of limited ultimates can someone have the same impact in a game of overwatch and the fact Overwatch has respawns makes it an entirely different beast. \n","\n","I agree that 'elo hell' doesn't exist so much as the SR system doesn't actually mean anything and neither does MMR other than finding you the most suitable games for your skill based on a multitude of factors that ignore the premise of competitive: team play. \n","\n","I can lock in any number of heroes and get gold elims damage and objective kills, or any one of the healers and get either gold or silver healing - but all of that is irrelevant. People are top500 with 30% w/l on mercy and people are sitting in plat with 70% win ratios. \n","\n","Really the idea of elo hell in this game is moot because rank means nothing and applies almost exclusively to the value placed on your hero by the games internal systems for deciding sr gains/losses and by how well your team plays together compared to the enemy, i.e if you win or not, a concept that's almost irrelevant in soloq ranking in this game. \n","\n","You can get better and you can climb but climbing doesn't indicate an increase in skill and falling in sr doesn't indicate a decline in skill which is absurd. I've never played a game with a ranking system so irrelevant. \n","\n","edits: grammar, cleared up some incomprehensible sentences, tried to make my point a bit clearer to avoid any misunderstandings.  nah I understand why it works in those elos I just find cheesing your way out of bronze can get you stuck back there if you're not improving on the things that made you bronze like aim and positioning. Unless you just plan to main sym then its whatever I guess.  I was thinking this. If we put any GM - Top 500 in Bronze on Mercy and told them to only pistol they'd climb out of bronze... o wait, they already have in numerous 'Support Bronze to GM' videos. Battle mercy is disgusting in bronze when you're a gm.   not really it's about learning to shoot when you're close to your target, track them during that time and hit majority headshots. Tracers full clip does nearly 400 damage iirc, thats enough to oneclip any dps. Anyone with 200- hp that doesn't notice you? If you hit majority headshots close range at any of the healers or dps in the game you have enough damage to one clip them. You can also oneclip Zarya but that's more theoretically if she doesn't have her shield up.\n","\n","Unlike what people are saying it's entirely possible to train your ability to hit more consistent headshots and it's possible to flank and oneclip a mercy, ana, zen, soldier etcetc it's all down to your aim and the situation. \n","Edit: everyones talking about discord, I, am not.  Sure he said so but I mean he hasn't released his data and I don't think anyone has compiled data for public consumption. I would be interested to see I'm just saying you can effect a higher number of games and you can win more games by playing better I just think there are a lot of factors that keep you down or help you climb other than just how you play. when I hit 2800 I didn't really play much better than I did when i was 2500 I just had good teams that communicated and we dominated everyone we queued into. Like I said previously I'm just giving my opinion from my personal experience I can't pull statistics out to prove my point but I'd argue your point is from a similar angle.  I've seen numerous people have that experience and me my self, on my alt account which is currently ranked 2400 but i'm being queued with Diamonds which gets me a bollock ton of hate for picking dps. I don't think anyone's compiled reports on it sadly but there have been numerous people questioning the SR system for similar reasons and I think SR is largely luck based once you get closer to your 'true' sr, which is why people consistently drop and gain 500sr overnight.  then explain how people can struggle to get out of gold then level new accounts and stay in diamond on them? Tell me.  I'm not saying they're the only reason I can't climb I'm just saying in theory being able to play comfortably at 2700 - 2800sr means that I should be fine in carrying my self out of, and into at least the 2500sr range? And now I'm at 2k - 2100 I'm having to hit aim %, damage done, elims and pulse bomb sticks on a level I didn't have to in higher levels. I have to overcompensate for my team mates so much sometimes It feels unfairly balanced at all. I don't know what is the root cause of this outside of my own issues but when there's 5 other team mates for my to coordinate with, all it takes is for no one on my team to work together and one person on their team to rally someone else on their cause and they instantly have a massive advantage over us. \n","\n","I started at 1100 and climbed to 2800 in a single season, I'm not incapable of looking at my own mistakes I just don't think the SR system reflects.. anything. I don't think it reflects personal skill UNLESS you're over 1k sr below where you could be placed, but I think there's a huge factor of luck that comes into soloq that is intensified by the number of people you queue with and how dependent you are on them through every stage of the game.  > You are doing exactly that. You are whinging about toxic teammates without ever considering the other team has them too \n","\n","but what relevance does that have to anything? Maybe they do sometimes, maybe I do, but there are numerous factors that go into an Overwatch game and it's not possible to win every single one, and when the majority of games are being tainted before we enter the spawn room by people fighting and shouting at eachother it's going to have a drastically negative effect on the game. \n","\n",">Just like roadhog you never considered how to fight him just whinged for him to be nerfed.\n","\n","Nice, but wrong, assumption there. I never whinged for him to be nerfed I always assumed he would stay exactly the way he was and that other heroes IF struggling because of him that shouldn't be, would be brought into line. Again you couldn't have known that because you got on your high horse every single comment you've left in this thread bringing up numerous times your lackluster achievements in this game to sway people. \n","\n","Again those top 500 players are mechanically reputable but a lot of them joined teams early, have been playing FPS for numerous years and have a lot of practice with coordinated team play. I feel this game rewards people for playing in teams and playing with better players than it does anything else. I think self improvement is possible but I don't think you can explain the reason people are stuck trying to get out of sub 2500sr and then level alts only to compete evenly with Diamond+ level players and manage to maintain their SR in those elos and say elo hell isn't a thing. Which one is it? They need to improve and elo hell doesn't exist or it does? this game is team based and coordination based and mistakes made in lower elos aren't punished to the point you can get away with murder in gold but the second you get to plat you lose three games and you're back in gold again. It can't throw people out of SRs so easily when it takes four times as long to climb into on wins.  Haha. You had a feeling? I don't whinge and blame my team but whatever. You're commenting your opinion on my opinion and it's kind of irrelevant, regardless you're still only diamond and we both have stuff to learn so we're just discussing our opinions on this topic, and roadhog. Like I said you're not playing an FPS if you're climbing with tanks.\n","\n","And I wasn't moaning about Roadhog I was stating an opinion others agreed with, it's a shame your Diamond level of play can't give you enough insight on how to play him better.   It's entirely luck based. Sometimes you get a series of teams that work with you but as a tank if you got the teams I've received where the whole team has started arguing before the game starts you'd have a different tune. There's a lot of people playing this game and it's entirely possible for some people to never meet toxic and abusive players and it's entirely possible for other people to queue only into them, and my personal experience has been abusive and toxic players who tilt them selves and the team and make the games harder to win. Also having your first 'fps' game being the one where you don't play an aim based hero isn't a good enough argument for your point regarding my self sorry. I play a lot of DPS, if played healers/tanks I'm sure i'd climb faster but then I'd be in a worse situation because I don't enjoy tanks and I don't want to invest into a role I don't like just to climb out of an elo I should be able to get out of if I can play on equal ground with players nearly peaking 800+sr above where I'm playing now.  \n","8018 It’s very clean!

My main criticism of Hollyhock is that *we* know that Bojack did questionable things but *she* doesn’t for sure. Did she ever discuss with Bojack what Pete Repeat told her? Did she give Bojack a chance to defend himself after the interview on TV? For all we know she just watched the TV program and turned her back on Bojack when things were about to become complicated, at no point talking with him about her doubts. Is this how you treat a person you have insisted to become family with? Do you immediately believe whatever terrible thing somebody else says about your family or do you at least listen to what they have to say in their defense? This is what bothers me about the letter as the means to cut the relation.

You may installed a leaked alpha version from somewhere. This a beta version, since the alpha version was released in January. My Dell XPS 15 has not been successfully booted on the alpha version. I am expecting something surprise me on the beta version.\n","Alphabet is too busy for such a integration you mentioned. Remix OS is based on Android.\n"," The user experience of these two versions are same. You can expect what you experienced from Remix Mini or Tablet to 'For PC' version, vice versa. The biggest fix is my Remix Mini could shut down properly.  You can turn on the automatic update of your Remix Mini. 2.0111 is available OTA. What kind of instances you are pointing to its worthless? I do understand that Android Ecosystem has its native problems. A desktop-optimized OS won't break the problems and take Android to other level.

The native characteristic of Android is fragmentation. We do have numerous choices, but it takes time to verify who is the best. I don't believe Cyanogen was the best choice. It is a good choice in 2015. MS  seemly have a cross-platform strategy for distributing its services. Cyanogen was the last move in Android Phone. Sadly, \"Hi, Cortana\" is gone.

In BD2? You have... not much to use the last jobs you get. BS>BD>BD2. \n","BS has the best gameplay but the weakest music tho, BD2 feels like something it's lacking but is still pretty good, BD is the first one and most memorable. Alright, many thanks Alright, do you think the deck needs her or it can run fine without her? Oh, sorry to hear that. \n","It has been so-so, mostly playing Manaria/20 cards deck during the day, it's okay but you really need to draw thos Anne tho finish the game also beating someone by targeting my Anne with her own spell has been the highlight of my day. \n","\n","Also just crafted a Fairy Forest deck, but because I never really played Forest since.... Darkness Evolved I pretty much lack every thing and I'm wondering if it's worth to craft Elf Queen as she is gonna rotate soon. \n","\n","Also tried to experiment with Spellboost and Buff Dragon with mixed results, so-so day in general, not particularly lucky nor unlucky. Oh, I mean I found funny the thing with Magna Zero and Magna Giant cause they are 2 giant ass robots having this cheesey drama that feels like it came straight out of some old school anime like Speed Racer or something xD\n","\n","Mono, Tetra and Aenea I actually like them. I love how the flavor text mentions that Magna Zero is Magna Giant lost evil elder brother and now Giant has to reclutanly fight his elder evil brother . It feels so stupid imaging this giant robots having this fraternal drama and am all for that lol. But the first Forte retrain was pretty bad overall too.\n","\n","Also, RIP Lymaga, at least she had an archetype unlike Garyu. Jeno, Albert and Sera are terrific cards but outside them, yeah not much going for Sword this expansion. \n","\n","I really wish they finally make good Rally cards, they are just so mediocre most of them... Maybe they are still afraid of Rally with how powerful it was during the first week of Fortunes Hand that make them do an emergency nerf? \n","\n","Anyways, I just hope at least Sword is fun to play, cause I liked Evo Sword at first but the last 2 expansions version of Evo Sword has been pretty boring ngl. I hope Sword finally got a Rally/Token or something akin to that but the ammount board wipe now in the game makes me thing it just won't happen unless Mini or next expansion finally  gives a good pay off for flooding the board or a way to make it survive a turn at least.\n","\n","Sera is amazing and I love her but she alone can't carry the deck. Yeah seems people forgot how actually good Canyon of Dragons was.\n","\n","We haven't seen the whole set and even then we wouldn't really know how the meta would develop, yet as always people are quick to comment with their gut reaction.\n","\n","She looks underwhelming but who knows, maybe she ends up being pretty decent or, dare I say, even good. Cards don't exist on bubble after all. Previous Forte Retrain was also pretty bad anyway so whatever, having Forte back is always nice. The first legendary I ever pulled was Fairy Princess, she was terrible even back then and Forest became was least played class but just for that I'm happy to see her back I guess, or not, depends how fun will be to fight Forest lol. \n","\n","Also she seems to take a note from Fairy Slaver dude and it's gonna make those damn faires make themselves useful. I'm just about to finish, absolutely loved the 3DS games there are some of favorites of all time and I think the negativity comes mostly about vocal fans of the originals games. \n","\n","Is a shame really, I was constanly thinking and comparing it with the 3DS games instead of just accepting it as it's own game and that definitely lower my enjoyment of the game. \n","\n","As I said I'm about to finish it and honeslty I had an mostly great time, but I will lie to myself if I missed some elements or I felt it was no living up to the previous games but it was just cause my attachment to those games is so great it clouds my judgment of this new one. That being said, it is a great JRPG, with such a classic feeling, so I say don't let those people take from the experience that it's this game, it's a good game that can stand on it's own. Uh, people are really losing their mind over this. This card is good and a staple of 3 in any deck that revolves around healing, but that's it. As long a good payoff for keep healing ourself exist this card will see play, and that's it. \n","\n","She is a marginally better De la File, yes. And that's accelerate is really good, but its totally dependant in having a good payoff for the heal, as I'm sure as hell I don't want to go -1 in had just for a 2 heal in most cases. De La Fille was good because Elana and Tenko Shrine exist, by herself she was just and okay card that made you a little harder to chip. The same for this card, in fact her body is waaaaaaaaay worse than De La Fille for costing just 1 less, and her leader effect is objectively worse. What makes this one good it's the accelerate, and not because healing 2 for 0pp is broken, is because they are stuff like Santuary and Elana that abuse this type of effects. Sen! She makes sense in Forest alright, which saddens me so much cause I don't play Forest at all and she is among my absolute favorites in GBF. Alas. \n","\n","Still, cute as hell. Okay, the current meta is really unkind to what Wilbert offers and Ward Haven kinda needs the high rolls to not be a worse Santuary Haven so the deck isin a rough spot nowadays BUT, Wilbert is a way, way bigger lose to Ward Haven than Yukari. Ward Haven can win without Ra. \n","\n","Anvelt and Sarissa High roll can won you the game way before Ra becomes a threat. And Wilbert accelerate is excellent, enables some really powerful Anvelt high rolls and it's even used sometimes in unlimited, if anything that accelerate will be a huge loss for Ward Haven more than anything. \n","His last words allows you to draw a bunch with Enchanted Knight to keep the hand healthy to the end game, his burn can be really devasting in some matchups. \n","\n","He is and amazing and crucial card for the deck that would be sorely missed once he rotates.\n","\n","Yukari is a bigger lose to Haven en general however, that's for sure. Yeah, it is the simplest way to describe the series to other people, I really can't think about another way that makes for most people to easily understand the core concept of the gameplay and the aesthetics of the series. \n","\n","And that frustrates me to no end, as I just feel it falls short and doesn't really convey the core magic of the series but damn it, is basically the only way people not already into turn based strategy video games can get an idea of the series. A personal grievance of mine, hence why I voiced my discomfort about it. [A BLAZE OF CARNAGE. THE DRAGON'S MIGHT IS GONE.

Well, house are built with the idea that people will live there but they don't necessarily have to have people in them, just ideally. Well currently Sword have been pushed to a midrange-control strategy with very little support for any other type of strategy. Sadly for it, currently it lacks a finisher for the type of deck it was pushed to make so it struggles currently.\n","And because the majority of the support in the past year has been towards that direction well, it lacks the tools to go in any other direction and hope to see good results.\n","\n","It worked wonderfully the past two expansion as it didn't lacked anything and the meta was kinder to it's main strategy, now it lacks a component for the type of deck it was pushed to be and the meta is far, far harsher to the deck it was pushed to run.\n","\n","Still, it sometimes happens, sometimes a craft is just not that good for an expansion or even more, maybe the mini will give it something, maybe not, maybe once UC rotates they will push for a new direction, or maybe Evo Sword will keep getting support, is hard to tell.\n","\n","One thing has been pretty clear however, what ever Cygames has planned for Sword, you can count it will still be Midrage flavored, Evo sprinkled or not, as it there's one archetype Cygames adamantly refuses to let it die is Mid-Sword, even if it sucks from time to time.\n","\n"," No matter what any of us here thinks of what Sword is or should be, for Cygames is exceedingly clear Midrage is a crucial part of what Sword is about, the historical evidence just speak for itself. I mean, that's exactly the problem, A! Tiki is not getting anything more stuff while Y!Tiki constantly keeps getting more. \n","\n","No one here is acting as if Y!Tiki is not important, is just saying that A!Tiki also deserves something, anything at this point cause sure Y!Tiki has her legacy an all an that's fine, it's not like she doesn't deserve it's just that A!Tiki also deserves something. \n","\n","And that's just were my CLY comment was trying to point, that people also care a lot for A!Tiki , not just Y!Tiki.\n","\n"," Hell A!Tiki complements and enhance A LOT Tiki original character, showing us how that lone child fearful of losing everyone has grow and cope with the fact that she indeed has and will keep outliving everyone she cares and loved and that's fine, cause they will keep living within her heart forever. So yeah, A!Tiki also deserves some love. I'm super certain than in the first CYL A!Tiki absolutely eclipsed Y!Tiki votes and in the western side A!Tiki was by far the more popular version. \n","\n","Not sure how thing are anymore now than IS is adamantly forcing Y!Tiki over her adult version tho. \n","8030 Thanks for that I got the graphics card for 148$ including shipping =D it's freed up some room in my budget so do you think I should upgrade to any better parts?

About a half an hour into swimming I was swimming in the empty lazy river that had only me swimming in it. I would always go deep as possible to touch the bottom. When I was returning to the surface for air something grabbed my foot and kept dragging me down. Almost everything went black except for sparkling light in the water, then that too went black. I thought I was going to die  with very little accomplished in my life. However that made me think about what I wanted to accomplished so I open my eyes and grabbed the side of the pool and shoved myself and what ever was pulling me towords the wall of the pool stop what ever was pulling me. I looked back and it was the bully who I argued with earlier. I gave him a kick and he let go. I ran out of a pool and told the nearest staff member what happened.

A private garden to sit and read or think. It's how we're wired. We're future orientated, and we're problem solvers. It's definitely helped me out on many occasions, sometimes with massive positive consequences. Is it healthy? As with all things, we need to find a balance. I've spent too much of my life extrapolating and trying to solve problems that sometimes never eventuate. Or they did eventuate and I realised I didn't actually need the master plan or elaborate evasive strategy I'd worked out.\n","\n","The reality is we can't control everything, in fact we can control very little.

A Very Long Engagement, Wild, Good Will Hunting, Show Me Love, American Beauty, Melancholia, Let the Right One In, Before Sunrise.  I lie probably the average amount, maybe more. I think it might be the Fe kicking in, where I see/feel what someone wants to hear sometimes and manipulate the truth a little to make them happy.\n","\n","I never lie about really big things.  No, not at all. My parents were both fairly scattered, and there were issues of alcoholism and drug use with them. So I was the straight, stable, non-angsty person who tried to hold things together.   I've never seen this as an INFJ thing, but I have a strong tendency to throw myself into learning something new (a new faith, a new system, a new philosophy, a new complex computer game) and then once I've finished learning it, I get bored and drop it cold without bothering to see it through to completion. Similarly I never finish the drinks I start, so I leave half empty cups of tea and bottles of water everywhere. Both of these things seem to be non-J. I guess I'm a closet \"P\" but there's no question I'm usually goal orientated, so it confuses me.  To make the people around me happy. I basically need to fall into a story I'm telling in my head to get to sleep. It's usually a pleasant fantasy and it changes every day. When I've had a crappy day I actually kind of look forward to whatever story/movie I'll be drifting off to tonight.  No, I'm not sarcastic at all and I don't think it's particularly an INFJ thing. I consider it to be very inauthentic when people do it, like they're afraid to be open so they have to disguise their real feelings/thoughts with this snarky side.  Equanimity. Sometimes I just say \"It's going to be okay\" when I'm feeling stressed. \n","\n","Other than that, it's a bit cheesy to admit, but I sometimes recite a couple of lines from a Mary Oliver poem to myself - \"All my life, I was a bride married to amazement.

It's tough, I know, but resist the temptation to turn the feelings off. I spent over a decade doing that, and it catches up with you. You can't compartmentalize or numb this stuff away. You have to learn that there is a certain beauty to feeling the external world (including people) as much as we do. If you switch off the pain you often end up switching off the good stuff, like joy, as well. Just accept your feelings, open and soften to them, sit with them. \n","\n","With your own pain it will help immensely if you can find someone to talk to, to let it out. I think INFJs have a habit of prioritizing processing other people's woes over their own and tend to neglect their own mental health, so you need an outlet, even if it's a forum like this.  I don't think people should ever meditate with a goal or outcome in mind. The point is to learn to be fully in the present, to be \"awake\". There are a lot of positive things that spill over from that, particularly for INFJs who tend to be very future orientated and disconnected from their bodies, but they shouldn't be the driving force. Intention matters a lot with meditation.\n","\n","If you're interested in mindfulness try reading one of Jon Kabat Zinn's books, or if you would like to understand the broader Buddhist framework behind mindfulness try Steve Hagen's Buddhism Plain and Simple.

The current form of nuclear reactor used is just a scaled up submarine reactor, it was never meant to produce power at a GW level. The IFR (integral fast reactor) is one of many reactor technologies that were developed and functioned well that were melt down proof and produced far less waste than current reactors in use.

If you have an older (80%) furnace which takes its combustion air from the mechanical room, you may need a source of makeup air (external duct, vent or louvered door) to compensate for the door being closed. Otherwise closing the door has no effect. They're bluffing. You have quite a bit of leverage once both parties have signed the lease. You can refuse to modify the existing, valid lease and your landlord can try to evict you. Towel bars or hooks, more than one. It's convenient to have towels close to anywhere you're washing up. I also recommend Panasonic fans and fan timers. The Panasonic fans are quiet and move a lot of air. If you want background noise, I dunno, get a stereo :). I prefer the old-fashioned analog dial timers. No more moisture problems. Just fire and forget.  Those sound a little small to be carpenter ants. If they are carpenter ants, however, they could be symptomatic of a larger issue. Carpenter ants nest in rotting wood. There's a nest nearby, either outside such as in a rotting stump, or inside your house, which could indicate a moisture problem which would put off buyers. Yes, I have created a plywood frame for a casement window with a plexigas window, as you describe. The frame was secured from the inside by friction fit, and also with clamps on the interior trim. I closed the window during inclement weather, but the entire assembly was fairly rain- and windproof even with the window open.  I skim-coated a small stairwell with a rough, 60-grit sandpaper type texture on the walls. If I had to do it over, I'd be 50-50 on skim coating vs. just replacing the drywall. I'd definitely replace the drywall it were a regular-sized room. Skim coating is a PITA and drywall is cheap. I would replace the trim entirely if that's an option, or recoat the trim with a gray primer and paint. Don't sand anything, just repaint it.

It's just that's not covered in the media at all, only the \"Al Sharpton has again appeared to stir things up\" meme is. Here he got criticized for not paying attention to black on black crime in places like Chicago, when he actually did just that, organizing an anti-violence summit as another example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_98ojjIZDI#t=3m22s I'm sure the people who he is helping feel very differently than how he is portrayed in popular culture.\n","\n","*He also forgave and fought for leniency for the guy who stabbed him.

When he's reduced to a sound bite I guess I could see how he's viewed that way. But when I actually listen to him, he doesn't seem like a race baiter at all, and seems pretty reasonable and well-spoken. I would change my mind in an instant if there were just one clip of him saying shit like THE WHITE MAN IS TRYING TO BRING US DOWN or something clearly race-baiting but I just have not seen anything like that, not even close (you would think this is the stuff he says based on people's opinions of him).\n","\n","Hell, I'm an atheist and he was the only person who I've seen outright win a debate with Christopher Hitchens just because he was more calm and reasonable the whole time, the opposite of his persona as an angry person who likes to yell. I feel the same way about Richard Dawkins. He says some strong or even inflammatory things about the God of the Bible (\"genocidal, vindictive, bloodthirsty,\" etc) but as a person he actually seems like a nice, gentle guy and totally undeserving of the \"dick\" moniker. Basically I don't think having a strong opinion on a certain issue that lots of people disagree with makes you an asshole or worthy of being so rudely dismissed.\n","\n","This thread wasn't meant to debate or stick up for the guy, though, I was genuinely curious if there was something I was missing out on that makes him deserve such hate. The worst \"dirt\" I could find was when Sharpton tried to help a girl who lied about rape. I wanted to see some actual race-baiting/yelling/being a dick to validate the popular opinion! It's always a little surprising when you hear how awful and what a dick someone is and then you actually listen to them, and they don't seem so bad, and even seem likable. At the risk of sounding like Al Sharpton, I wonder if there is a racial component to it, like \"will that boisterous, silly black man please just shut up already?\"\n"," Okay, but any specific examples of \"race bait\"/\"brings up hateful things\"?

I enjoy the thought of them having sharp teeth and looking like sort-of-cute, sort-of-predatory little monsters. A bit goblin-like I guess? But I suppose them looking like humans could also be a glamour effect, or they were created by Wiggly with that look for the purpose of filming the commercial. Or maybe your (op:s) suggestion is correct! I was kind of under the assumption Wiggly couldn’t influence/interact with humans until that first portal was made - and that he couldn’t really reach into our world and influence more people until he made and distributed the dolls.

However we just joked around and really didn't't think much more about it. Then later that night the guy walked out to smoke on a balcony and after about 10 minutes i randomly thought oh shit I hope he didn't jump in a kind if joking thought and went out to find him and when I did I just stood out there and talked with him for awhile. We wound up coming in and ending the night, but the next morning there was a moment where he got me and a couple other people aside and thanked us heavily for cheering him up and helping him move passed things as he had been extremely depressed and had bad thoughts days before.

It is not a date. The separator used is \" : \" not \" / \" or \" - \" which are comment date separators. The specific choice to use \" : \" makes this a clear timestamp formatted as HH:MM:SS.

Like imagine someone who's taught about Maxwell's demon and believes it's a real thing and not a thought experiment and lives their life with that belief that there are these demons running around violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics. How true does that have to be to be useful vs how useful does it have to be to be true. Like what if he observes one of these demons and he is factually accurate - it's true, they exist, and then it's totally unrepeatable. Well for all intents and purposes they don't exist. But, follow me down this wonky example for a bit. Suppose these demons are real but they don't want to be bothered and manage to communicate that fact very clearly, and that you will be rewarded by being spared from the heat death of the universe if you keep the secret and protest anything other than the thought experiment. So humanity goes to great length to teach people in a way that convinces them that particles behave in a way similar to a world where there are these demons, but they absolutely aren't real, and then as we approach the heat death of the universe people start to wonder why we are in the macro sense not dying from heat death but at every observable level entropy is still a thing. People start wanting to know the truth, but if anyone spreads the secret of the demons we all die instantly (no one knows the truth) and if the secret is kept we all survive (no one knows the truth). Sure the demons will exist after we are gone, but they may have no concept of truth, they might even be nullified by something after we lose the ability to observe them.  I really didn't like Jordan's position at first but it started to come around for me. If every person was periodically asked \"who was the last president?\" and the answer that kept you alive was \"George Washington\" then no longer would the scientific truth matter in that situation. Either everyone would stick to their guns like Sam, and we'd all be dead with no lasting knowledge to say something was true or it wasn't, or people would fold and accept that George Washington was our last president for whatever that means to satisfy the irrational universe we live in and that's that. I think they are both just silly word games actually because at a certain point it all falls apart - you can bend the truth with a hammer of usefulness but it doesn't work the other way around. I find myself getting bogged down in the nature of truth argument pretty frequently. I think it all boils down to there's no yardstick of truth, which both agree on. Given that truthiness is itself fuzzy on some level, we must have subtly agreed that truth itself is useful even if all truths are not useful. It could be that that subtly agreement is inaccurate, and our concept of truth is not itself true. A fuzzy concept of useful can be useful enough to be true but a fuzzy concept of truth can't be true enough to be useful. A useful truth value must supersede a truthful truth value.\n","\n","It is inconvenient that scale then becomes an dimension of truth, but that's not actually that inconvenient because it's built in to discussions anyway since we use shorthand all the time. When people say the universe is a cold dark place, we are really saying on average what we can see is a cold dark place, but it could be there's some far away portion of the universe that is constantly contracting and entropy is always positive that observes that the universe is shrinking, bright, and hot - and our conception of truth would have to reverse as well. At that point of termination we would then learn that the belief the universe being cold and dark is not only not helpful, but not true.\n","\n","Or when the madman asks you to give his inaccurate order of presidents, if that situation scales to millions of madmen invading everyone every night, the definition of the phrase \"order of presidents\" quickly changes from chronological list of people elected to lead the executive branch to list of names in a madman's head.

This is a prospective life partner, not a pet or a dog. Trying to indirectly change your SOs behavior to suit you is toxic, manipulative behavior - when there is an incompatibility like this you address it clearly and directly, and either both make adjustments or accept that your differences are irreconcilable and move on.

I'm not restricting their negativity by criticizing them for it I believe most of this information was posted to the No Man's Sky game website. For example, the release date, particularly the PC one.

I had this issue and tried everything to fix it.

After coming across the male Red Pill community on Twitter I was intrigued.

I started by reading an OG feminist named Mary Wollestonecraft. It may be a bit hard to read because it was written in the 1700s, but it made me truly understand the roots of feminism.

From what I can gather it sounds like your husband may not fully grasp exactly what it is you want. Men usually need specifics. For example, you mentioned you want him to be the “captain of the ship”. Usually that means he is the sole decision maker in the house. It may be easier to tell him you want him to make decisions on something specific. Then when he does, do not try to change his decisions and do not complain about it. Just let it ride and see where that goes. \n","\n","The second thing-it sounds like your love language might be “words of affirmation”. You’re craving this validation of being seen from your husband and the way you want it expressed is from his praise.

What bothers me the most is all of the comments about marriage and kids. No, it’s not marriage and kids that does this to you. It’s simply eating more calories than you need and not exercising regularly. I’m married with a child and I look better now than when I birthed him. People seem to get lazy and it’s not marriage/kids that is the cause of laziness. It’s yourself, your habits, mindset, lack of goals, etc. Also, if two people have proper communication, mutual respect, and loyalty to each other, looks really don’t matter as much.

Check the pinned post at the top of the page there’s a bunch of links for complete beginners and where to start!  Thank you. We actually have heard about it before. Currently my mom is doing an experimental drug and taking cannabis oil alongside her treatment. So far she has been having clean scans! I will do some more research on the vaccine though just to be better informed.  Since the “me too” thing has been viral I have seen quite a few stories from men that have experienced sexual assault and as a woman I think that is as equally as important. While this is specifically meant for females I don’t see anything wrong with men joining because as females we NEED men to support us in this. If men come forward as people who have also experienced this then I think it will help in the long run. Essentially, the point is to bring awareness to sexual assault and how OFTEN it happens to people. So, in turn that means that almost equally that means that there’s that many people committing sexual assault. This is what women are trying to make aware.  When I was younger I thought my clitoris was where my pee hole was. I always get the sensation to pee in that area. Later, I found out the pee hole was below that and just above the vagina.

My mom has stage 4 lung cancer and when through chemo and radiation at the same time. It took so much away from her, but she never lost any hair or anything so it was hard to tell she was sick unless she was throwing up or physically couldn’t walk because of how weak she was. People are so shitty. It’s worse that even when people do know they act like you’re already dead... that’s the worst. My mom is still here fighting and still looks like her normal self all the while she’s in the hospital every week doing treatments. \n","I wish you the best and I hope even though you’re going through this that you make the best of every day with what you have. 💕  I’ve heard this was a thing before and after reading the comments my mind is blown. For me, sneezing is terrible and painful and I almost always pee a little too... not sure which one is worse.  Once my husband told me he was working late and later I found a receipt in his shorts for that date and time. I confronted him about it and found out he just lied so he could go to the movies and be alone for a while. I just felt bad that he felt like he needed to lie to me about it, but I wasn’t mad at all. In fact, we now have a policy that we often take time to be alone away from the home. It has been wonderful for our marriage!  Birth Control is so universal and covering this will have a huge positive impact for millions of women AND their families. This doesn’t just affect women. The whole country can benefit from this. The decline of unwanted pregnancies and abortions and less tax payer money going to WIC, food stamps, etc. not to mention the millions of women who are on oral contraceptives as a form of medicine for diseases and health issues. \n","\n","https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/birth-control/facts-birth-control-coverage-women I don’t know if it’s the norm in any other places, but I would especially be attracted to a yoga center that had child care and flexible hours. Although the knowledge the teacher holds and their ability to connect with the class is equally as important to me. Also, classes for complete beginners that are extremely inflexible or have mobility or health problems are very important. But I live in a small town so I pretty much take what I can get.  Are they sending to US residents?  The traffic really is as bad as they say. Especially in the winter. DO NOT DRIVE IF IT SNOWS. People here do not understand what to do when it snows.

Thank you so much for your kind words. I loved Schlutz! \"I KNOW NOTHING\"!. But damn when your gentile s.o.quotes him everyday Yeah. Since I was a gentile married to a Jewish man, we made it all right by setting up conversion of our children as soon  as possible to the kosher mikvah, asap. Whether I am Jewish by birth or Jewish by choice, my children are Jewish. They were converted in the Mitvah and I was not officially converted because I did not have 500 dollars as a single parent nor the time to officially convert.According.to our.schule, 12 weeks and.$500.  Either way and no matter what, I do believe i have the right to be sensitive about Hitler shit and History channel shit and fake German accent shit from my partner and the right to just plain say, \"cut it out\"! I started to read Mein Kemp when I was in high school and after several nights of nightmares, I had to put it down and return it to the library. Thank you so much for your empathy. Kids are out on their own, which is good. Daughter is 38, has a child and living with fiance.  Son is 34 and living with dad after bad breakup with girlfriend of about 2 million years I am like so sick of hearing how the uniforms and boots were so hot. Yeah, but, they were murder outfits! I would love to learn German. My ancestors were 4 generations off the boat Germans. But I don't  to see over and over again what happened in the past. They were on the boat for a reason. Though they were being \"funny.\" Thank you. Thank you so much. Most everyone else on reddit is throwing me under the bus. My S.O. made an oven joke in the past and my children scoffed and then left our house. Just a joke they said. I would give my life to save my children. I'm not a converted  Jew because I didn't have the $500 dollars or the 12 weeks time for conversation lessons as a single parent. I used to love watching The History channel but for some reason  and some point in time it became all WWII. They think Hogans heros is funny. But in no way was that any real indication of what actually happened to POWs in WWI>. I was overwhelmed with the schedule also. Especially the hose. Been trying once a week but hard to get soap all the way through. Letting humidifier receptacle air dry daily. Mask every other day. Gonna keep on wearing it and doing what I have to do.

Emphasis too much on transgender and medication management. I'm gonna push for her to have a sleep study done. Tonight no matter what the mark and I will prevail! I told her tonight that I'm going to keep on using the machine and if she doesn't like the way I look, look the other way. What really makes me think is the fact is that why I am going to bed with my mask, she is snoring quite loudly all night. Around 7. My setting on the machine is 8 now. Not a troll at all. And I am also female. My wife is transgender. I married a man. I'm 63, shes 56 and in no way do I consider myself unattractive. Just I am who I am and I know I look absolutely strange with my mask on (like the Borg queen in star trek) but I did not expect to hear quite an outburst. Thank you! And I hate mines too!

I'll be honest, it's going to hurt like shit for awhile. But it's like waves, some days you're an emotional wreck and  just don't want to do anything anymore, and other days you're alright. But with time, it'll be okay. It's very emotionally and physically draining, but trust me it does get better. It's been 4 months since my (ex)girlfriend broke up with me, and just now I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I urge you to stay busy and socialize, don't stay slouched up on Reddit all day, because It does get better. This isn't permanent, but suicide is. PM me if You want to talk, I'm here.

Instead of being somewhat rude (?) to her, understand it in her perspective. She can't be with you because she can't cope with depression, she doesn't feel herself. This is not deliberate, it's not as if she decided \"Yes! Today I will have depression.\" It's gradual, let her know you're there for her, make sure she's okay and let her know you're okay. How you reacted is probably making her feel even worse.

I boost and get what I need and spend it always have 4/5 workers active so I can drop available loot into walls. Not best option for all but works for me. You gotta do what is best for you. So many options out there and you can make your own option also. Just enjoy your journey! This is good stuff great job guys! I enjoyed it. Not essential right away if you drop leagues. The strategy I am suggesting is to get easier war opponents and gives u chance to get familiar with your troops. It works well for me but if you are more worried about loot retention then you need to drop more defenses. The new meta's at th10 are bowlers learn bowlers and do not war without bowlers. Also any laloon variation you can master. So lava, loons, and bowlers should be highest you can get before you war and work on heroes like other guy said. Also whatever you do no defenses till all troops are maxes and heroes are at least 25/25.\n","Walls are important also and existing defenses should be maxed for current level before new ones are added when u are ready. Would not hurt to hand around gold league until caught up also. Just my $.02. Good luck and enjoy your journey. I am currently doing this route. The way I am going is all gold for new Tesla, Tesla upgrades, and leftover on walls. All regular elixir on  Troop upgrades and dark drills. All dark elixir on heroes. I try to do both heroes at once to keep King ahead. I dropped to silver and milked resources and earned alot of defenses. Even visited bronze. I also did traps and bombs along with upgrades of traps and bombs. I still have not done any other defensive upgraded til I have all troops done. Then elixir goes to walls and gold to defense. Good luck and enjoy the journey. Good news after the calls and emails to customer service I received an email informing me that my new Galaxy s7 was being shipped free of charge. I can now say I will remain with T-Mobile and not switch. Not like everyone else. My continued loyalty helped pay for the infrastructure. The same infrastructure they are now using to reward new customers while telling loyal customers \" No soup for you.\" I will go with who does best by me. Cable will usually give you the new customer price  Yeah that is the plan go wherever the deals are Hopefully u do well with whatever u do from this point on and we will be here if u ever decide to return. Good luck and never forget coc There is a subreddit specifically for recruiting.... /r/ClashOfClansRecruit Yeah the clan is UAE VICTORY We are looking do not miss this chance You are not that rushed just concentrate all gold on walls and all elixir on lab and troops and u will be fine. The attacking gets better with better troops... U are not that rushed... Do not do any other upgrades til you have purple blue walls and lab at least half troops at your th level #CLUCQ9Q HARVESTNFARMS Yeah th7 can only get lvl. 2 hogs Yeah op is cheating all Tesla's and traps are visible r/seduction R/seduction That is awesome he did the ol okey some on you lol I would suggest lvl. 5 to start practicing but lvl. 15 or higher to have great success. It is a great way to get D.e. Queen walk is usually a war attack. Super Queen the funnel is the key Oh yeah use archers or minions to funnel any troops giants and bigger and healers will leave queen No super Queen is getting the Queen into the core and uses 6-8 healers, Queen walk is having Queen walk around base and uses 3-5 healers usually Walls are never a waste. If u war walls should be ur first upgrade. Walls, spells, and lab. \n","8114 Hello there, Ms. Badu. \n","\n","I regrettably had no idea who you were before a friend of mine linked me to the thread a few minutes ago. From reading the posts, it seems that you are reasonably chill and stuff. Since there's not nearly enough nerdery in here, I'll ask what we all want to know: do you play video games, and if so, which ones do you prefer? In addition, do you enjoy card games (poker, spades, Magic the Gathering) or board games (Monopoly, Carcassone, Pandemic) with friends and have you ever tried tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons or Vampire, etc? As a closer, since many people say they like \"all music but rap and country\" what's your favorite country, western, bluegrass or folk, etc. group? I'm still not sure what's wrong with those people, but whatever. No problem man. I just have a lot of factions and thought I might as well report/share the issue. \n","8115 I think this is a perfectly reasonable amount of chores for an 11 year old to do! It looks like a pretty similar list of responsibilities to my own 10 year old—right down to the dishwasher being broken with a back ordered replacement part lol. It’s not like you’re kicked back while she’s scrubbing baseboards. It’s very minimal effort to help maintain the house. Keep it up! This is shockingly more common than I would have anticipated. I work in bankruptcy and the number of clients I have who literally have no idea about their spouses income or finances is truly astounding. I often have people (primarily late 50+ year old women) who are living off of a couple hundred bucks social security and ultimately being unable to file because their spouses vehemently refuse to provide their earnings even though we’re required to disclose all household income. Before I got too deep in and realized that Moira is just THAT extra, I thought it was a real rich people ensemble that I, a poor, just didn’t understand. Oh, I absolutely agree that fed is best and I didn’t intend to come off otherwise. I guess I just meant in the sense where it was feasible for me to breastfeed because we didn’t have any issues with latch/supply but it just took a lot of mental encouragement to keep going past the first few weeks as a new mom. I loved my spectra s2, the pump itself was great and the flanges were super comfortable. If you’re going to be returning to work or want something more portable I have a freemie too and while the wireless aspect of it is super helpful, I prefer using it with the spectra flanges because I thought the in-bra cups were so uncomfortable! I’m about to hit a year bf with my son this week and my biggest piece of advice there is, if it’s what you want, dont give up! Stock up on nipple butter and don’t limit yourself to just nursing in a chair. See what’s most comfortable for you and just be patient. I won’t lie, the first few weeks were hard and painful while I adjusted to nursing but in the end the bond is just so unreal. Milky mama on Instagram has been a great resource for me and she has some awesome products too! I know how that is, my sons daycare is the same way. I’m sure it doesn’t help your little guy having to be so abrupt though, especially if he’s so used to you guys being at home. It will keep getting easier as time goes on, especially if he’s already made baby steps with just approaching the building. I’m sure there will come a day that he races to the door without a second thought. Hang in there mama ❣️ You’re not a bad mom for taking him to school! It says a lot that he’s fine once he’s in the classroom with his friends and is always happy to tell you about his day. I wish I had something in the way of advice but my LO is only about a year old so the daycare separation anxiety hasn’t really hit him yet. Maybe before bed you guys can try talking about something fun he told you about in an attempt to give him something to look forward to other than the dreaded drop off? Have you considered speaking with a bankruptcy attorney? Filing a chapter 13 may give you additional protection from eviction. I just pitched in what I could. Sending you all love and I will keep you in my thoughts for a safe holiday and delivery ❣️ you’ve got this, mama I would look into whether there are any mutual aid or medic funds locally near you. Keeping money within your community is so important and a lot of mutual aid distributors can take your donations really far, whether it’s toward groceries, housekeeping supplies, helping keep your neighbors lights on after falling behind, or getting someone in a hotel for a few nights instead of a shelter or their car. Ok first and foremost, the fact that he put an expiration date on your relationship shows clear as day he does not love you. I know that’s hard to swallow, but you just don’t do that to your partner.\n","I struggled with the fear of never finding anyone either when I was your age, and I stayed in a dead end relationship for way longer than I should have because of it. Once I left him, it was hard for a few weeks but ultimately I really came into my own and learned a lot about myself and what I wanted in a partner, and that was so important moving forward in my next relationship. I know your early-mid-twenties seems like a vital time to settle down, but you’re really still growing and becoming your own person so much during this time. Dump him, take some time for yourself, and things will fall into place when they’re meant to. Oh, honey. So much of this resonates with me. My son is almost a year old, I’m still struggling a lot with ppd/ppa and I know that if i were to get pregnant again I would feel the exact same way you’re feeling now. Especially if you have people pressuring you to keep popping them out or guilting you in a way by “making sure” you really only wanted one kid. \n","I know that considering abortion is so, so difficult but you owe it to yourself to really weigh your options, especially at this point in the pregnancy. Don’t keep it if it will only manifest resentment. Have you and your husband discussed it together or are you just coming to the conclusion privately that you don’t feel you’d be able to go through with it? I’ve been having this problem since my period returned 7 months pp. it’s really hard and adds a whole load of additional stress because I get my freezer stash back to a comfortable place and then have to deplete it all over again to feed baby through the day at daycare. I try to remember to take a calcium, magnesium and zinc supplement and have oatmeal for breakfast in the days leading up and that helps a little bit! Good point. I appreciate your help! Thank you! I’ll do that. Should I try to remove the root of the vines I’m trimming or would that be more traumatic to the plant? This is Seymour. He started as a single 3 leaf vine four years ago and has been my pride and joy as I typically have a black thumb. He was outgrowing his last pot so I moved him into a bigger one and he deteriorated pretty badly. His vines are pretty scraggly now but are finally growing new leaves at the ends again. Should I cut my losses on the long vines and just clip them where they’re growing to plant them and start over? Of course! I was a stepparent to a toddler first and for whatever reason thought that becoming a bio parent would be a walk in the park because I had “experience”...but infancy is no joke. As a mom struggling with intense bouts of ppd/ppa even 11 months later, I know how you are feeling. It can feel so ugly and heavy at times. But I promise in hindsight the good will far outweigh the bad. My inbox is always open if you need a void to scream into. If your wife is breastfeeding, my advice would be to consider safely accommodating for co-sleeping. It was the biggest lifesaver for us. The first two weeks were damn near impossible until we started doing that.\n","Beyond that though...I didn’t believe it when I heard it, but give it another 4 weeks. Then the 4 after that. So on and so forth. You will progressively see these hard times through rose colored glasses. You are both great parents providing for your little one in such an uncertain world. Take turns giving each other breaks. You’ve got this. Another friend of mine suggested that too! Honestly I’m not seeing much of a difference very often, they usually go back and forth being super producers one day or not producing much at all the next. This is almost the exact scenario with my grandpa as well. His presented initially as back pain and bi-weekly fevers, docs thought maybe he was developing COVID until he finally got a full scan and found a rectal tumor and lesions throughout his liver, too far gone to operate. Happy to hear you beat it and wish you all the best through the future! We don’t have a set bedtime but we did start a preparation time. My sons late afternoon naps always vary depending on how he did at daycare, so bedtime itself ranges from 7-8:40 usually. No matter what “bedtime” is that day though, at 6:30 every night the screens go off, we have some food, if it’s bath day we’ll do that, play on the floor and read until it’s about 20 minutes to his “bedtime”, then I’ll nurse and put him down in his crib. My son started daycare at 2.5 months and then was home with us from 3-5 months due to COVID. We started using huckleberry over that time to start tracking sleep and when he returned to daycare I was pleased to see that for the most part his naps stayed on track with the huckleberry sweet spot timing even though I didn’t communicate that with the staff. Granted, his naps are much shorter there (20-30m there vs. 1-1.5h at home) but they’re great about knowing his cues and timeframes.\n","He’s 7 months now and thankfully being back in daycare 5 days a week hasn’t caused a rift between his at home nap schedule either. He still naps great when he’s at home (now if we could get some nighttime sleep that would be amazing haha). Hopefully you and your little have success transitioning! Congratulations!!! That first ultrasound surge of love is so amazing. Best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy! I also have a freemie and found it worked okay for modesty’s sake and the price point is way better than the willow. It’s nice that the cups can fit under clothes, but I definitely recommend using it in a nursing tank vs a more structured nursing bra. Narrowly avoided a few clogs that way. My biggest issue with it was the flanges not being terribly comfortable. I considered sizing up, but I’ve ended up just using the portable pump with my spectra flanges. I was in the hospital for a day and a half after actually delivering—about 48 hours total between check in and check out. Everyone’s actual delivery is different though. I had an epidural so I don’t remember really feeling pain (thankfully) but whew I screamed big time. It was more for the power. Once I started hollering with all my might he was out in 2 more pushes. My delivery team encouraged me to let it all out, and over our stay I heard a few other mamas shouting too...it was kind of funny because pre-delivery it terrified me to hear them making feral noises like that, but post delivery I was like “hell yeah mama do the damn thing!!!” \n","8116 First off are you on LiveJournal because ALOT of Lolita's hang out on there (me being one of them!) or DeviantArt is another good place.

I'm thinking my skin is just sensitive. I'm currently not using any moisturizer and the skin doesn't feel dry or oily. What spot treatment would you recommend?  Hi, i noticed whenever I use moisturizer on my face, I would have an outbreak of acne. I have tried different moisturizer from different brands, I also try cream Vs gel, but same outcome. Generally, my face only gets dry during winter, just around the nose and upper lip. I got a lady who told the carers that she wanted to see the boss, so I came to talk to her. She needs hearing aids but doesn't wear them because she destroyed/loss her last 2 pairs.

Another funny story, when I first started working in dementia, a resident always tell me that I looks beautiful and she loves me very much. It made my day and I feel that I have special connection with the residents. Found out 3 weeks in, she said that to every single person she sees, crushed me heart a little. I have been working in dementia care and I have lots of funny stories. One of my residents once asked me if she could borrow some money and she told me that she always pay her debts, same resident once had an apology speech in the middle of dinner. Another time, I was doing my paperwork at my desk, and a resident was standing nearby looking through the newspaper and then she suddenly yelled out \" I can do it, I can do it\", really motivational. When I asked her what can she do, she just looked at me and walked away. I realized I told my friend yesterday that \"being sad is not gonna help me\", so I decided to be more positive.

I’ve been coming to OTF for over 3 years but somehow was always out of town or something for the previous ones. My goals were a sub 8 minute row and a sub 30 minute 5k and I accomplished both of those. Shaved about 5 minutes off my 5k time from a year ago so really proud of the work I’ve put in this summer since my studio opened back up again! 💪 The Graces and The Curses by Laure Eve has this exact aesthetic, I devoured them each in a day they were so good! The Cassie Palmer series by Karen Chance has some of this vibe 28F also from Maryland! The Modern Faerie Tales and Darkest Partnof the Forest by Holly Black as well as her Coldest Girl in Coldtown, this one has the vampiric vibes but is more of an urban setting. The Graces and The Curses by Laure Eve have a bit of this spooky witchy vibe Into the Wilderness by Sara Donati, has a very similar early America vibe but I would say more of a romance than Outlander Just recommended these before seeing you posted this as well. I think they absolutely fit the dreamy fairy tale vibe of this image! If you like a little darker fairy tales I would recommend The Modern Faerie Tales by Holly Black.

There are English versions of quite a few of these works. Darkest Part of the Forest - Holly Black Army of Shadows by Joseph Kessel, if you read French you can read the original text, L’armée des ombres. It is a story about the French resistance movement and is both poignant and brutal. There is a film version as well. I missed that you wrote this first, but yes this is immediately what I thought of! It’s a slightly different vibe but it immediately made me think of The Veldt, a short story by Ray Bradbury Deerskin - Robin McKinley Not OP but I use Maybelline BB cream almost every day and love it. It’s just enough coverage to make my skin look like the best version of itself. I generally wear it with just a filled brow and mascara and it looks like I put a lot more effort than I do.

I was living abroad at the time and would have had to wait to have an abortion until getting back to the States. The father never knew and I never felt like I needed to share it with him. I have never wondered what might have happened if that baby had lived and I know for certain that I am not cut out to be a mother.

You're still alive, which is better than most people who have ever lived. \n","\n","Yeah I do a good job at being alive, woo, that's basically all I am doing at this point and only because I know it would be hard on others if I killed myself.  No matter how much I want to go through with it. >When it starts getting too much you really do need some outside balanced input from a professional. Try and find a CBT therapist to talk too, it will help you figure things out an enable you to cope better.\n","\n","I do see a therapist who is terrible but only one of a few in the state that I found fit the \"not a religious healing nut\" category.  They too agree that my anxiety is probably my issue and have also told me its \"very weird\" of how I'm not jumping at the chance to go run around in women's clothing and whatnot. >The reason why people say it gets better is because it really does get better. \n","\n","It really does not >There are a million and one paths in life. You don't know for sure that one won't make you happy.\n","\n","I am pretty sure.  After all I spend my time constantly thinking about it.\n","\n",">I've been there. I think almost all of us who who are trans have been there at one point or another. It is very difficult to deal with this stuff. I would suggest that your depression and anxiety are partly caused by being trans. Going through life in the wrong body and in the wrong social roles is incredibly distressing!! Your feelings are valid and they make sense. LOTS of trans peeps have similar feelings. I know I do. You are not alone. Others are like you. And it can get much better for you.\n","\n","Yeah lots of them have similar feelings, and how does that end up?  They either go and ruin their lives to be \"happy\", somehow have the best of luck and everything works out for them, or they end up dead.\n","\n",">Your friends most assuredly mean well. They are probably afraid that transitioning can be a difficult journey and that some of us are faces with hurdles like transphobia and discrimination. They love you and they want to protect you. They are ALSO full of shit and don't know shit when it comes to being trans. Anxiety doesn't cause trans!!! But being trans and in the closet WILL cause a ton of anxiety!\n","\n","They aren't saying the anxiety is causing trans feelings, they are saying that my anxiety is probably my problem. Just like in the same line that they've said I probably feel this way because I am lonely enough and no girls pay attention to me, so I want to be a girl just so they will open up to me easier.  Or just that I want to be my own girlfriend.\n","\n",">You don't know that. Hormones are magic. They can make a massive difference in how you feel.\n","\n","Hormones are not magic.\n","\n",">Yes, you can. You are doing it now, by making this post. By reaching out. By saying \"this is hard and I need help!\" That actually means you ARE dealing with your life.\n","\n","But I am not, I am instead just going through the motions that make it appear like I am having a normal life.  But instead I come home from work and do nothing but want to die.  Then it comes time for bed and I go to bed, then repeat the day.  And of course days without work I just want to die the whole day.\n","\n",">You and me both! Once I realized how much I had \"just had it\" it was like a switch had been flipped and I was then free to pursue transition!\n","\n","My switch is going to be pushing me over the edge to drinking/drugs/self harm or worse.\n","\n",">Your next step: Find a good therapist who has experience helping transgender people. Talking about this stuff on Reddit is good. Talking about it with another person, in real life, one who has experience. That is also good. And different. I don't want to say \"better\", but I think it is valuable.\n","\n","There are none in the state that specifically help transgender people.  The one I got now is terrible but it took me several years to stumble upon them and get the courage to go.  Switching therapists would be even worse.  Even talking to non therapists isn't something I can do since everyone just gets sick of me and tells me the same thing all of you are, without actually wanting to help.\n","\n",">Another next step: seek out a community of accepting trans people. They are out there. They (we/I) want to help you. But you have to do the very brave and difficult part of entering the space and saying \"I need help\". AND...you CAN do it.\n","\n","There are none in the state, and none that I would be a part of if so.  Also I have bad anxiety, what makes people think that I want to go to some group meeting for trans stuff or could even handle that?\n"," \n","8145 Thank you. I agree. I'm not comfortable even having a ouija board in my house. He wasn't a very strong swimmer. He could swim just fine in a pool, but anywhere else he wasn't very good. He had previous close experiences with water as a child.\n","\n","The river he drowned in was controlled by the hydroelectric company, so the currents could change at any time. There have been previous deaths in the river because of that, including two divers (whose bodies have not been found) and a 17-year-old male from the area who was found in the same place that my brother was found. My dad is the only one who cuts the lawn. Somehow the grass grew longer into a \"G\". It really is interesting. But I don't know... It could've always been growing longer in that one spot but we never noticed it until now, y'know? \n","\n","I was thinking about that. Like maybe he's living in another dimension where he survived the drowning, where his friend was able to pull him out in time, and he's just going about life as if it were normal, and that world is clashing with our world. I like that idea. It makes my entire family really happy to see signs like these and think that they're my brother's way of trying to communicate with us. Whatever makes them happier, I don't care. Some things I think my parents are looking too much into, like white paint splatter on our basement floor (from previous tenants) looking like a dove (it does not look like a dove). But if they're finding comfort in this stuff, then sure, it's a dove.\n","\n","Thank you x It has been really fucking difficult.  \n","8146 Great PM your details. Thank you so much.  As one who suffers from, and is currently working on a course for enterepreneurial depression, I applaud you in reaching out. It is in fact lonely and uniquely challenging. All the best.  I'm also happy to be in the slack group.  Thanks so much for your feedback. You ROCK!!!\n","\n"," Hey thanks for your insightful feedback and suggestions! You ROCK! \n"," While entrepreneurs could be VC, the course target is the entrepreneurial group which often are pressured, bullied, cajoled and stressed to depressed by VC. Not that all VC are bad, they aren't, but the pressure real or imagined is among the reasons closet depressed entrepreneurs give for not being more forthcoming with pressure they are having trouble with.  Alright my friend. The first thing you could look at is..breathing.\n","Yes, it true. Your body does in fact need oxygen. And when we players get to practicing, etc, we forget to do that. Tension happens because of this. If you ask me what you should do is take ten minutes every day to play so slow it doesn't even count as music, imagine well this may be weird, but here goes. Work at plucking the strings SOOO slowly. Think as if you weren't actually moving your fingers, they were moving themselves. Ok? For awhile when you start this you are using so little pressure and strength, the string won't even be fully sounding. Do this as routine for awhile, and remember to breathe. Truth be told, I once was at the dentist, and he wasn't breathing, and I was like doc, are you breathing and he's like no. He said he held his breath cause he didn't want to have bad breath and have his patients breathe it in. I was like doc you may want to start breathing. Then he tells me hes have all these hand pains, and such. Got to breathe, and do the other stuff I mentioned. Or not. Best of luck my friend.  \n","\n","Edit I notice you are having problems right now anyway with the left hand I'm assuming your fretting hand. In that case do the same exercise but now you are doing the same thing only getting an incredibly fine sense of all the aspects required to fret a string. Once again all the best. HAha. Seeing that Carvin logo..I have a Carvin fretless 5. It's black limba. AWESOME>>>.. only 1500. Cheap to me?  I really appreciate your enlightening me on this. Sounds pretty cool. Thankfully doesn't obviate my product either. I could add it in maybe... Hey IPYF. So when you are playing a song, or just messing around, would you like to know exactly what you played? What notes? Yes, you can use like Logic, or whatever, and the program may do an alright job, but what if it was much more capable, and not so futzy? Would that be of use?  HAhah. I've never heard this. Interesting. When you say string players, you are speaking of like cello, and violin? I should clarify my device is more for when you are playing a piece at speed. A drone tone would rapidly lose effectiveness compared it.  So when you are training to play fretless, you favor having a particular note playing, and that allows you to learn the sound and feel of certain notes? Forgive me, I didn't learn this way.

Tim Ferriss is probably the most surprising and most upfront about the reality of facing depression.. He's on record as saying he almost committed suicide. I appreciate your discourse, as this is EXACTLY why I'm on here, i.e., depressed entrepreneurs just like many others who suffer from depression hide it, and then it bites them. It bit me. Whole years of my life taken away, and the truth is for me it wasn't that bad. You are right entrepreneurs do hide it, pretend, etc. The stories you can find are of high level business men, who need help, but won't do anything because of the VC they are trying to keep happy.

I discovered a couple of numbered \"inspection\" stickers adhered to the fabric, one under the collar and another beneath a pleat of fabric on the back bottom. Those numbers did not mean anything to me, they are 11145 443 and 11145 446. That's magnificent... or an abomination... or both! Thanks for sharing a picture! No hoops and no map pocket on back for this one. But it has mad crazy pockets, plastic lined with drain grommets to stash birds on each side, and and another pair for spent shells just above.

I recommend racing games. They usually don't have a story worth caring about and you can fine tune their difficulty so that you can give the appropriate amount of attention you want to it. Forza 4 is a good choice if you haven't played it but any that take your fancy will work. Does anyone know if the skills that require button presses work when equipped by the AI Characters? Things like Rhythm on Rita. I would prefer paper money to bad cardboard coins. For example, Mombasa has really small coins that look and feel bad. Like two weeks ago, there was a thread about how Dan isn't as dumb as he seems and I didn't buy those arguments then and I don't buy them now dammit.\n","\n","For the record, I don't think he's dumb, he just doesn't seem to think about things that other people would. Consider the number of time he says \"I guess I never really thought about it\".\n","\n","Also, I love Dan. So this fixed itself and I don't know how. Having the same issue. I'm on chrome. The issue is only present when I'm logged in. When I log out, the theater(or cinema) mode works like it did before. I read through the entirety of the comments on that video and no one accused them of being white supremacists. Maybe I missed something. Both are great at two so it depends on what type of player you are. While there is a little more going on in GWT, it's not insurmountable.\n","\n","FT is more interactive than GWT and has the potential to be a meaner game as moves you make block or completely cancel moves they could potentially make. \n","\n","GWT doesn't have this. You are always interested in what the other person is doing and certain actions they can take will mean removing opportunities for you but it's not as nearly as brutal as FT.\n","\n","An important distinction I'd draw is one of possibility space. GWT always has a limited possibility space. You have plenty of options and routes to victory but your immediate actions are always limited. This is actually a good thing. It means you can strategize effectively by thinking ahead because you can see what options you will have in the future. This limited possibility space also means you have time to consider your opponents potential actions as well.\n","\n","By comparison, FTs possibility space is massive. There are so many moves available to both players at any time that it can be overwhelming to figure out the best possible move. It's also not something you can plan ahead for because actions your opponent takes will change a significant number of the available moves. The number of actions do decrease as the game progresses and you will get better at identifying great moves but it's still a lot.\n","\n","I usually play both of these games with two players and enjoy both at the player count. I play with my father who analyzes as much as he can before making a move. With GWT, our games are consistently under two hours (post learning games) while our FT games are consistently over two hours and come close to three on many occasions. As someone who also loves Deftones, I would recommend listening to their newest album as well as what Alex suggested as one may convince you more than the other and will give you a better range of their work.\n","\n","Personally, I don't enjoy anything before the White Pony album as the Nu-Metal influence is too strong. Yeah, I don't love it as much as I expected to either. It feels incredibly modern and streamlined for a JRPG (a genre I love so this isn't a dig) but the shallow story and characters take away significantly from my enjoyment. The combat is well designed and fun but the low difficulty means that I don't have to actually engage with the systems all that intelligently, I can just mash and do pretty well.\n","\n","Scott Benson tweeted about how this felt like a game made for kids, which is something I agree with and it explains the difficulty. But I don't think it excuses the bland story or the lack of difficulty options. For the record, Scott never said these things were excusable.\n","\n","I do enjoy the game quite a bit but it could have been so much more. Tales of Berseria came out last year and does not have the production values that this game has and probably goes on a little too long but it's a game that's going to stick with me for much longer. I remember Efka saying that he prefered Mombasa to GWT so unless that has changed, Mombasa will be in the top 5. I walked around my house shouting \"Oh my god!\" at everything Dan was saying during that clone discussion. \"They're clones\" is an airtight justification for what was basically a description of slavery.\n","\n","It was hilarious but I'm glad Vinny cut that off before Dan dove deeper. I'm glad Dan said something about this. I've never doubted that he didn't already believe this but there are other people who believed he was an apologist for Trump (I remember one even tweeted at Alex). Between this and his comments on immigration, I'm glad to see this side of Dan.  Watched All The President's Men for the first time a couple of months ago, not having any idea about the line, and burst out laughing. I'm well aware but it's weird that it doesn't disappear on it's own. It doesn't take up the whole screen so I don't even notice it for a few seconds until I need to use that part of the screen. Hey, you're having the same problem as me where you play with the scoreboard up because it doesn't go away like other games.\n","\n","Nice kills btw I'm happy for the dude getting to platinum as I am nearing ot as well but if one of my friends posted something like this, I'd do the same as you. :)\n"," I can't tell if some people here aren't getting the joke or are being deliberately oblivious.

Got any tips for teaching a dog to chill in the boat while it's on the water? Use her crate comfort to your advantage! Do you have a big enough tent to fit the crate inside? Set them up at home and have her sleep inside the tent, in the crate, so she associates the tent with sleep. I actually brought my dog's crate along on our first car camping trip. She slept in the crate (in the tent) the first night, then loose in the tent after that. To protect the tent floor, I brought some of those foam puzzle mats. Sure, but they have to remember to check them. I wonder if it's common for blind people to have their clocks chime the hour. STOPPP, we celebrated our anniversary at Summerdance too. What is going on? Are you me??\n","\n","Domefest is in May and Resonance is in September - they were our first and last festies of the summer. They're both small, friendly festivals. Highly recommend! I agree!! I wonder if we've crossed paths before. Haven't been to either of those yet, but Electric Forest is an absolute must for the future.\n","\n","We live in Central PA (State College) but our favorite venue is Nelson Ledges in Ohio. We've gone to Summerdance for the past 5 years and it's the best vibes!! Resonance this year was also a blast and Domefest is a local favorite.\n","\n","Have you been to Camp Bisco at Montage Mountain? We did Peach for a couple years and loved the water park aspect, but Live Nation security is bananas! This is wild. I also met my boyfriend at Bonnaroo 2012. We also both came from Pennsylvania with mutual friends, and didn't meet until we all camped together at Bonnaroo. We talked recently about how much it means to me that he loves music festivals as much as I do, for many of the same reasons you mentioned!\n","\n","Every festival we attend makes me love him even more. We are the happiest form of ourselves at festivals and we bring out the best in each other. We have learned to do everything as a team - watching out for one another, embarking on long road trips together, setting up increasingly elaborate campsites, and dealing with whatever inevitable obstacles get thrown our way. We have met incredible people and experienced many of our favorite moments at festivals.  I could go on and on about the ways that music festivals have improved my life, and I'm very grateful to be with someone who makes the experience even better. The motorboat...if you know what I mean. ;) Expect the worst and you can only be happily surprised. Convincing myself I was in the clear only made it that much worse when I got it.\n","\n","While I agree with you that that's how it *should* be, many cops believe that your good intentions go out the window as soon as you break the law. This makes a lot of drug users/underage drinkers afraid to call the cops when their friends OD, so good on you for doing it anyway and maybe saving a life.\n","\n","Side note - if you haven't already, write down everything you said to the police. Right now. Memories get mixed up when you and your friends discuss it later and you really don't want to contradict yourself in court. Also depending on how your parents will react, you'll probably want to give them a heads up. They'd rather hear it from you than from the cops or Penn State. The $200 fee is from Penn State for alcohol awareness. You may also be put on probation for a year, where you just need to not get caught again. The citation itself will probably cost you another $300, but I believe there are payment plans.\n","\n","Unfortunately for your friend, the supplier could get in a lot more trouble than just an underage. But it really depends on the cops - how was your exchange with them? Did everyone cooperate? They probably would have told you if you were getting off with a warning, but you never know. I got mine in the mail a couple weeks later. It was State Patty's a couple years ago so they were probably a little backed up, so you can probably expect yours a little sooner. Also expect to be contacted by Penn State and put in (very painless) alcohol classes.\n","\n","They will cut deals sometimes, so if you want to fight it get a lawyer. If not, you can get it expunged pretty easily after you turn 21. YES. Has anyone used non-prescription contacts for a costume? How much do they bother your eyes?

I was thinking of ripping some holes in it and adding fake blood? Maybe be a zombie monster? All ideas welcome. \n","\n","Also - would it look weird to have fake fangs when there are already teeth on the hood? Interesting, do you have any other info on this?

If says that to everyone, she just thinks you're being funny. If she only seems to say it to you, she's testing for your reaction. I had a guy friend who did this for years. I always knew. It made me *really* uncomfortable, especially since I was with someone else, but I joked back because I didn't know how else to respond.\n","\n","Maybe stop making that joke and she if she says it first. That means she enjoys the joke (or feels the same way) and you can keep it up. If she doesn't, maybe consider cutting that shit out.\n","\n","Best of luck to you.

Just consider that not all pollinators are generalists, I don't know what proportion have have a 1:1 relationship but it should be a significant proportion since as a plant, it would be in their interest that most pollen makes it to their own species soon. Bee is generic term (Super family Spouses) that covers thousands and thousands of species. Bees are the flag bearers for all pollinators because they are cute and there is a cultural connection. In reality, bees are a canary in the coal mine. We know of bees species reduction because they are actively searched, but we have very little knowledge of other less \"charismatic\" pollinators.\n","Think it like this, there is ecological niche, pollinator, that is suffering. Our best measurement is through \"bees\". In addition to habitat reduction. Absolutely true Unfortunately human would not be enough to cover the ecological services provided by pollinators. Maybe for food or cash crops but not for everything else. 1) In addition to other replies other issue: The vast majority of the oxygen is produced by plankton. However sea acidification, which would affect plankton, is a real issue. All the CO2 that is currently being sink by plants that use a pollinator (directly or indirectly) would go into the ocean water further acidifying the ocean that would kill more plankton and further acidification. If this kill cycle stops there is chance there would be humans around.\n","2)No, our societies and economies are heavily \"subsidized\" by the environment. We use more than it's replenish. There would be a nasty revolution and adaptation process. If there isn't a thermonuclear war there will humans around.\n","3)Short of swarms of billions and billions of robotic pollinators that have the existing variation of pollinators, there is no solution. We might be able to artificially pollinate food crops but for how many people? Also once the food networks start being disrupted it is unknown what will happen. As it is now the ecological math quickly goes into (mathematics) chaos. Out understanding of ecological relationships is in its infancy.

The spookiest place I've ever been too was in the backwoods of Camelback, Pennsylvania, I had to have been eight when my family and I went to investigate an old still sight. As my dad disturbed the soil and leaf litter I heard a sharp scream, \"Get Out!\", and saw a Shadowy figure, with a red aura in the second floor ransacked building.

My brother was in the back seat and thought I had lost my mind.\n","\n","Thing is... it felt really good to actually get to talk about that stuff so now I just do it all the time.  I get if this is too personal but what convinced you to come back to Machinima? Was the legacy of IG just too much to let go of or did you also make up with those in charge?

When I said it wasn't possible, I heard nothing for the rest of the day, assuming okay, shes found a ride, right? Nope. Got a message from her 2 hours before the wedding that her and her family weren't coming because of the weather.\n","\n","When I spoke to her a couple days later after calming down, she played the martyr card about how dare I think she wanted nothing to do with it and how upset SHE WAS about not coming. Cmon, trump weighs way more than 132 lbs. This exact thing happened to my mom, but she didn't learn the truth until she was in her early 50s, and only because she requested a copy of her baptism certificate.  Their relationship was already fractured for over a decade and a half when my grandmother left my mom to take her of her dying parents and then tried to accuse her and my father of mismanaging things in their favor. So I definitely can understand the complicated relationship with your bio mom. Will she be ok on the bare bottom? The crate has those plastic trays.\n","Its weird because it doesn't start until shes been in the crate for a few hours, and sometimes its intermittent, or doesn't happen at all one or two nights. This is...oddly specific. What did she say? Five Finger Death Punch. I was in theaters, and I did not appreciate it. It was ALRIGHT, but for some reason this is still the only 3d film for me to ever get a headache from Audition. I feel like I'm one of the only people on the planet that found it to be abysmal. It was SO SLOW until the last half hour. It did NOT need to be 3 hours long, and despite seeing it over a decade ago  I still want those 3 hours of my life back. I had one student tell me about how her mom is on her period. I wouldnt say mine was a predator, exactly. He was 21, but hung around kids who were around 16, and claimed he was only 18. I was 14 at the time and was just excited that and older guy was paying attention to me. We only ended up dating for about a month, 2 of those weeks he was out of the city.\n","Found out later he was also dating another girl on the fringe of our friend group who was 17 at the time. Nothing sexual ever happened, mostly just kissing and cuddling. And we didnt find out his real age until he was arrested for robbing his job at the time. \n","He learned his lesson though, and hes worked hard since prison to become a better man, and I have to say hes done a really good job turning it around. My dad also has deteriorating discs in his back.  I dont know if it helps, but they told my dad when he was 20 that hed be in a wheelchair by the time he hit 50. Hes now 71, semi retired and cant sit still, so has taken up gardening. I cant tell you EXACTLY what medications he takes, I know theres only a couple, but he keeps going through proper medication that works, exercises and topical ointments. To be honest, he really didnt even start taking care of himself until his early 40s, either. Am I fat/ugly? And wear the most unflattering clothing/hair/makeup possible. My husband said, \"if hes that stupid to keep doing this after 7 years, he deserves to have his money taken.\" My husband nailed it last night when I told him ashes only clients were singles    \"Is he trying to be the real life WILL smith from Hitch? He knows that's just a movie right?\"  Didnt have the heart to tell him that hes probably banging them too lol. Lol but he couldnt even say that! Or \"I own multiple properties and I rent them out.\" He gave this stupid, roundabout answer. It's such a simple explanation! I would LOVE to watch this, please can I get in on the Dm list? Yes! They humanized killmonger because what he wanted was right, but like you said wrong execution. Weird, right now its showing WWE Dream Match Mania for tomorrow night from 8-10pm .....😒🤔🤔 Anyone know how we can watch this in canada? Its isnt showing on the wwe network??? Theyll never work in the summer because it was written into their contracts. It's not a matter of wanting to or not. Theres also the limited number of schools with a/c, which can become a health hazard. My classroom had a heating issue in our wing a couple weeks prior to mar h break and we almost had to move rooms. I cant even imagine how bad it would be in the summer weather. \n","8191 Add me gingerdick99 \n","8192 Sexy Why don’t you start with post any pics of yourself for a start?

Your exactly right. I wouldn't want to give statehood to a people that hurls rockets at me unprovoked would you? That is why they require certain pre-conditions. Palestine is run by Hamas a recognized Terrorist organization that stated they want to \"drive Israel into the Sea. Why would you want to grant statehood to a people run by a recognized Terrorist organization? I'm not saying they speak for all Palestinians. But until they can show themselves to be moderate they don't deserve to be a state.  I assume you mean the Palestinians firing rockets at Israeli civilian settlements? Israel will not come to the negotiating table while this is happening. That is why Hamas must acknowledge Israel's right to exist and stop firing rockets unprovoked. \n","\n","\n","\n","  What Israel want's is official acknowledgement by the Palestinians that they as a nation have the right to exist. Hamas who were elected by the Palestinian people have the stated goal of \"driving Israel into the sea.\" Hamas has all the military might in Palestine and are supported by the Palestinians. Israel in the past has made land concessions in the name of peace. They have given up over 50% of their land including the Gaza Strip. What were they met with? More rockets. \n","\n","Israel does not want to give up the West Bank in the first place because strategically it provides a buffer zone of protection against Hamas and their rockets. Tel Aviv Israel's main city center would be in easy striking distance were the West Bank to be given back to the Palestinians.\n","\n","Until Hamas acknowledges Israel's right to exist and stops shooting rockets unprovoked there will be no more peace negotiations. Yeah. Its impossible to win since any evidence you use is biased Islamophobia. Any Surah's or Hadith's you cite can only be interpreted by Muslim Scholars.

Not only that but Children of Israel refers to the Land of Israel which prescribes its ownership to the Jews not Muslims most of whom say Jerusalem belongs to them.\n","\n","This verse in the Quran was originally taken from the Jewish Talmud in Mishnah Sanhedrin:\n","\n","\"Therefore the man was created singly, to teach that he who destroys one soul of a human being, the Scripture considers him as if he should destroy a whole world, and him who saves one soul of Israel, the Scripture considers him as if he should save a whole world.\"\n","\n","Surah 5:33 seems to prescribe what Muslims are to do:\n","\n","\"Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment\"\n","\n","The term corruption or (mischief) in other translations is pretty vague and could be used to justify attacks for a lot of things. Like killing US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan or the people who fund the wars like the US tax payers. A good example of this would be the recent Boston Bombings. >Those who follow the Quran would not oppress, but would fight the oppressors to defend themselves. \n","\n","So the people who force Coptic Christians to cover there heads because of Sharia law weren't following the Quran?\n","\n",">We fight oppressors who are Muslims and non-Muslims.\n","\n","I don't see that happening in Egypt.

You mean like this?\n","\n","[Lets Enhance!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"," Matthew 5:17 must be understood in context with Jesus purpose in coming to the Earth as a man. The law has 3 distinct categories which can be based on the subject matter and the way in which they were brought about:\n","\n","* Moral-Given to Moses by God-Exodus\n","\n","*Ceremonial-Jewish Sacrificial system, the Feast days-Leviticus\n","\n","*Civil-The Judicial law directed at Israel; Stoning for Adultery etc.-Deuteronomy \n","\n","\n","\n","Another thing to understand is that law is the English word used for \"nomos\" in hebrew which means something to be parceled out or allotted it can also be a custom. So understanding the full context including the original Hebrew helps make this a little clearer.\n","\n","With all this in mind we must establish a couple precedents before moving forward. \n","\n","*The assumption that God came to Earth as a Man(Jesus)\n","\n","*Jesus was perfect. \n","\n"," With that said when Jesus died on the cross he took all the sin of man upon himself. He fulfilled the law because he kept it perfectly and took man's punishment for breaking it(death). He also fulfilled the Prophets as they had predicted God's coming to Earth as a man in the OT as the Savior.\n","\n","The meaning of Jesus \"fulfilling\" the law is predicated on the understanding of his coming to die for the sins of mankind. \n","\n","Romans 6:23-\"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\"\n","\n"," As such the law is still in effect but thanks to Jesus we are no longer bound by its penalty. \n","\n","Moving on to specifics of the laws:\n","\n","Jesus told us to keep the moral law(10 commandments)\n","\n","The Ceremonial Law for example required the Jews to sacrifice a lamb to God. Since Jesus died on the cross however he became the human sacrifice. So animal sacrifice is no longer necessary. Thus fufilling the law.\n","\n","In John 1:36 we have \"...and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”\n","\n","When it comes to the Judicial law this must be understood in context as it was written to the Jews as they were wandering the desert looking for the promised land. The laws(customs) were meant to keep the Jews following God as they were God's chosen people. He had only revealed himself to the Jews no one else. If anyone disobeyed such as committing adultery they were to be stoned for example.\n","\n","If you look at John 8 Jesus encounters a woman accused of adultery. The mob wished to stone her as the law stated. Jesus asked the people \"let he that is without sin cast the first stone\"\n","\n","John 8 ... \"Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”\n","\n"," “No one, sir,” she said.\n","\n","“Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”\n","\n","Here is a clear instance of Jesus not enforcing the Law set by Moses in Deuteronomy. Is Jesus a hypocrit? No. Because he became the sacrificial lamb we are delivered from death. Thus he fulfilled the law with his death.\n","\n","\n","The moral law is enforced time and time again in the new testmament. Jesus doesn't come out and say \"keep the Ten Commandments.\" But the elements of the 10 commandments are all referred to as sinful. \n","\n","Matthew 19:18 ...Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery \n","\n","So to sum up Jesus fulfilled the law by dying on the cross as a sacrificial Lamb. Removing the penalty of Death. You are not supposed to be stoned for committing adultery. Jesus himself did not enforce this. \n","\n","I wan't to be clear that those types of penalties in the Old Testament clearly have no place in society today, nor does the Christian religion require this. This is all based on what the Bible says of Jesus teaching, not a half-hearted attempt to make the Bible relevant in today's society.\n"," If your a monist then do you still believe God is Transcendent? \n","\n","Because Monists hold that God is not transcendent and that his entire being is in the  matter which makes up the universe. Every leaf tree, and animal. As such the only way to worship God in Monism is to worship animals, trees, cars, boats. Whatever object you like because Gods being is in all and not outside of it. \n","\n","\n","Eph. 6:4\n","\n","One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.\n","\n","...who is above all...= Transcendent\n","\n","and through all, and in you all= omnipotent\n","\n","God is transendent as in he is above all and exists outside his creation. He is omnipotent in that he can be everywhere and see everything. God exists outside our universe in other words. He is not creation, he resides outside creation but as with his creation he can be everywhere simultaneously but his spiritual essence does not physically or meta-physically, or spiritually exist soley within every molecule on the planet. \n","\n","When I pray to God I pray to the Transcendent God as a separate entity. Worshiping physical creation as in creatures or objects is not biblical.\n","\n","\"For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\" (Romans 1:25)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"," Christians don't believe God Inhabits everything. The belief that God inhabits everything is Pantheistic Monism. Christians believe God created everything in the world ex nihilo, and that God is omniscient and omnipresent, and omnipotent in that he can be everywhere and see everything at one point in time. We dont believe however that God spiritually dwells within and is part of everything. Christians believe that when we accept Christ as our personal Lord and Savior that Christ also God may dwell within us as people. I suppose the Holy Spirit could be viewed as a force. But God himself is a fully individual being who transcends all creation, and also one in three parts. And what do you mean by you suppose this makes us monists? You don't seem very sure of yourself first off. And Christians generally don't believe this\n","\n","A monist is a term used in Philosophy \n","\n","Monism is the view in metaphysics that reality is a unified whole and that all existing things can be ascribed to or described by a single concept or system. If you mean that All things in this universe as a reality can be defined and operated by God alone this isn't necessarily true because as I said before Christians believe God transcends creation.\n","\n","I don't see how you can say \"We Christians\" and call Christians monists. Christians are not monists we are Monotheists. Muslims of course believe Christians to be polytheists due to disagreements regarding the concept of the trinity. But to say you speak for Christians and call us monists is false. You are more then welcome to call yourself a Christian and believe in Monism. This belief however according to mainstream Christianity is false. Muslims also know that we label ourselves as Monotheists not Monists. So you cant go around saying that as if it is something that all Christians believe.\n"," What kind of Chrisitians accuse you of polytheism because of the Trinity? All Christians believe in the trinity because of our belief that Jesus is the son of God. Evangelical, Protestant and Catholic's believe this. If a Christian were to accuse you of being a polytheist for emphasizing the Trinity then he is not a Christian. That is unless there is more your not telling us. Some Catholic's are viewed by evangelicals as violating the 10 commandments for worshiping images of Mary and such. And could maybe be seen as worshiping another god. But to be called a Polytheist by Christians for worshiping the Trinity makes no sense as the trinity is still one God. I only hear Muslims calling Christians Polytheists. I have never heard of this term being used by Christians on other Christians unless they are following a truly warped version of Christianity. So from your point of view Homosexual acts deserve death. What about acts like fornication, consumption of alcohol and pornography? Does this deserve death as well? \n","\n","What about unbelief? In the Qu'ran Allah says that he hates the unbelievers. Does this mean that unbelievers deserve to be judged by you as well? and whats the punishment? Why are Muslims taking this so personal? Its only showing Terrorists!

What I do see are Muslims asking for the resignation of NYC police commissioner Ray Kelly for showing a video to recruits expressing the dangers of radical Islam. This video includes a moderate Muslim like many of you trying to expose radical Islam. Why are so many Muslims against this?\n","\n","Then I see groups like the MDL in London chanting \"death to you by Allah\" \"We love Usama Bin Laden.\" \"May Allah Bomb you\" \"May Usama Bin Laden bomb you!\" \"You will pay with your blood.\"\n","\n","http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8E4rMJVHyeg\n","\n","The NYPD is trying to keep NYC safe at any cost.

They must have some sort of secret ingredient i thought. after trying literally everything from the supermarket and not coming close to the plasticy taste of the hut i actually went insane. i started clawing at my skin, scratching my face for hours with my long sharp fingernails. at first it was almost unnoticeable but i knew i could not hide the scars forever, soon enough karen would find out. I needed to put an end to this but the only way to do that would be to outpizza the hut, as i knew. so i tried one last ingredient. i cut off a piece of my own arm and put it on the pizza. i added the shittiest sauce i had and cheese made from 50 percent plastic and 50 percent wood chips and baked it real good. the taste was almost exactly like pizza hut but the meat wasn't tender enough. i knew it had to be younger meat. from someone much younger than me. i knew what had to be done. there was a moment of doubt as i grabbed the knife and went into holly's room, up to her little crib while karen was at work. but i knew what had to be done.\n","\n","I'd finally done it.

Only thing i like about blacknite, is the level desing. It looks good. Everything else, not for me Rng factor is good, it keeps the game fresh and different everytime. Combat is not always there at the same time, against same enemy, with same gun, same skill. Theres good variation. Nothing wrong with netcode, its just that we HAVE TO play with people from around the world, not just our neighbours nextdoor. Its not competetive game like cs, yet its harder than that.

Too bad its just another console game for kids :( Im thinking exactly that, you just cant give up the \"uav\" mode that gives unfair advantage and free kills for camping style gameplay.  What exactly is low skill ceiling in pupg? And the rng is only for environment, which keeps things fresh unlike thousands of hours of de_dust2, which is totally different and fine in its own.

Hi waddupsac - younger 20something y.o. guy here who moved here half a year ago facing similar challenges.\n","\n","Here are some things I've tried to meet folks our age:\n","\n","* **Join [Xoso Sacramento Sports Social League](http://sacramento.xososports.com/)**: You can join with others or as a free agent (aka single). The norm is to play a fun sport (ex. dodgeball, kickball) then grab some drinks afterward. I've only been to a free dodgeball event so far, but I met some cool folks there. I'm about to start playing in a league for the first time, so we'll see what I think afterward\n","* **[Midtown Stomp](http://www.midtownstomp.com/) on Friday nights**: Swing dancing/lindyhop for all skill levels. From 8-9pm is a drop-in beginner's class where you can learn basics of swing dance, and then 9-midnight is an open floor where you can try out the things you learned. Decent mix of singles and couples. The age range can vary - I saw teenagers to middle-agers, but at least when I went there seemed a decent number of 20somethings\n","* **Open Mics**: I've been pretty happy with the open mic scene here in Sacramento, and usually on any given weekday night there's some spot with an open mic or karaoke or something musical. This one's a little trickier because: 1. it helps if you participate yourself as a way to get to know others, 2. not as viable if you're hesitant about going to bars solo\n","\n","Other options include checking out meetup.com or even dating sites like okcupid (partly to date, partly just to meet folks); I haven't used them yet, but I know others have. Also, there have been /r/Sacramento gatherings occasionally, including things like Nerd Night (see the right sidebar). \n","\n","If anyone else has any other suggestions, I'd love to hear them too.  I'll second Townhouse. As a note, they call their Monday nights an \"open mic jam\", so anyone can jam along with an open mic performer (unless requested not to). If there's no performer, strangers just jam away together and rotate frequently so everyone can play. Adding Enter Sandman - it sounds like a good idea at first, but then there's the gradual realization that the intro is 1:10min of confused head bobbing. I always brace myself for the final \"Hold onto that feeling\"... yikes. No problem =).  Is \"Sahara\" what you're looking for? http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0318649/ Welcome to Accenture! I'm also a SI analyst based out of Sacramento and working on a local project. I only joined a few months ago out of college  like you, so I can't speak to your more skills/career-oriented questions (the other folks here seem to have addressed those questions well). But feel free to PM me for details about Sacramento and local projects!\n","\n","In general:\n","\n","* I would expect to be staffed on a local (government-related) project since you're based out of Sacramento in particular.\n","\n","* St. Charles training is a blast. The training itself has become more difficult than years past (reportedly), but you should be fine given your previous programming experience (you'll probably be helping others quite a bit). I made some fantastic friends there and loved the added bonus of weekend visits to Chicago.\n","* Ditto everyone's advice of taking whatever responsibility you're given and run with it. Do well with a little, and folks will trust you with more (most folks I've met so far are already super-friendly to start with).\n","\n","\n"," Ditto. First Muse concert for me. Quite stoked =)  Fantastic game OSU. Craft and the rest of your crew know how to defend the hell out of a team and shoot some smart [midrange] shots (although, y'all rushed some when we tied it up). I was afraid Thomas would get more shots - his range is scary. Will be watching y'all with great interest the rest of the season. \n","\n","BUT OUR HOUSE. Lost the offensive rebound game for umpteeth time in a row, but steady free throws and some much needed transition points from solid defense pulled through. Plumlee and Sulaimon(!) rocking the senior-freshmen presence. Kelly providing some key buckets to get us going at the second half's beginning. Cook showing maturity hitting those FTs at the end (and that huge assist and layup during the last minute). Thornton proving he's a lockdown defender. Hairston with those cleanup buckets that he's been doing so well the past few games. What a way for all to step up, especially when Curry was being hounded like no other. \n","\n","Next few games will provide a breather for us thankfully. Geez I can't wait for March.\n","\n","EDIT: We were reallllllyyy fortunate y'all didn't have more 3's go down. Only 6-21 this game. Haha yeh. We've been getting especially killed on offensive rebounding lately, although if it saves Mason a foul or two I don't mind (at least until Marshall is back). \n","\n","Agreed about the qualifications. Not to mention how early we are in the season.\n","\n","I hear you about Sulaimon - he plays as if he's an upperclassmen. In general I'm stoked for what's to come. The team overall seems more confident than before (ex. better FT%, more guys driving into the lane, decent handling of full court pressure, and even more blocks by Kelly and Mason).  Thank you! The hope was to add and not to detract.  Oh sweet, that must have been fun too. Haha any chance of a recording? Suppy played a fantastic game. Great job dealing with the early Banshees, pestering Polt's expansion efforts, and then finishing with a nonstop onslaught. Congrats to him and UCB.  Yeh I feel you.

Coach David Cutcliffe has done a good job though trying to turn the program around since taking over five years ago (albeit there's still a long way to go). On a brighter note, the team regularly graduates almost all of its players.  Agreed about it being many people's number ones; I didn't mean to diminish that. My point more was similar to your last sentence, that even folks who were unsure found reasons to love it here. Current senior, Trinity '12. Absolutely love it here.

Your review definitely moved it a bit up the to-read pile! Great post. *I Served the King of England* was hands down the best book I read last year. *Closedly Observed Trains* was good as well, where as *The Little Town Where Time Stood Still* didn't do much for me.   \n","\n","\n","Great to see some love for Hrabal on this sub. His writing really brings a smile to your face, and it doesn't make you cringe from excess pretentiousness which I feel his countryman Kundera's does.  I finished the Recognigtions this week, which I‘ve been reading since the start of the year. The first chapter was one of the best pieces of fiction I have read in a long time. All of the party scenes were pretty fun to read as well, as was all of the obscure references. For some reason I found this encyclopedic nature far more intriguing in this book than in Foucault’s Pendulum which I absolutely loathed. \n","\n","The theme of forgery was quite interesting, and I think Gaddis did a great job of showing how it seeps through society in various ways, but I must admit that a lot of it flew over my head. What part Esme played in it all, I am not quite sure. The ending dragged a bit I think, which might say more about how fatigued I was at that point than the book itself, but all in all it was a good experience.\n","\n","Right now I am reading the Oresteia, which I got interested in by listening to the Literature and History podcast.  I found it to have too much of what I don’t like about Dickens and too little of what i do. What I do like about him is his vast gallery of wonderful characters, each of them one dimensional, but as a whole painting such a nice picture of humanity. I do, however, find his female characters so poorly written. Bleak House is about 50 percent a first person narrative from Esthers point of view, that I found close to painful to read. In addition, I had a hard time relating to any of the rest of the characters. \n","\n","On top of that, as English is my second language, I need to concentrate a lot when reading Dickens to catch all the small stylistic features he uses. I think that, as I read Bleak House, I sort of found less and less reason to put in the effort, causing me to miss out on some of the things that I’ve learned that other people appreciate about it.  I finished Dickens' **A Tale of Two Cities** over christmas. I am usually in the mood for a plot driven story this time of year, with lots of time for reading. This is my fourth Dickens. I remember being really fond of Great Expectations and David Copperfield before being completely turned of Dickens by Bleak House a few years ago. This one felt a bit less Dickens-ish than the others, but it was definately a nice read. The first half slogged a bit, but the second half picked up. If you can keep from frowning when he gets too sentimental, it makes for a great experience. \n","\n","&#x200B;\n","\n","Also, I reread **The Dead** which is becomming sort of a tradition. *\"Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age\"* \\- gets me every time.   \n","\n","\n","At the moment, I am reading **The Steppe** by Chekhov. The writing is beautiful, and it reminds me of the vacation I had on the Mongolian steppe a few years back. Anyway, not much happens, just a boy travelling across the Ukrainian steppe meeting people along the way.   \n","\n","\n","I'm taking the opportunity here to conclude the great reading year 2018 has been, as well. Two highpoints have been Heinrich Böll's **Group Portrait with Lady** and Bohumil Hrabal's **I Served the King of England.** I didn't know much about any of these beforehand, and both made for completely unexpectedly awesome reads. Check them out and read them, you won't be sorry. 2018 was also the year I finished Proust's **In Search of Lost Time,** having made it to the third volume in january. Proust can be tough at times, but all in all it has been wonderful. I honestly think that reading his long diversions on art has been one of the reasons for my getting in to classical music.  I remember having some trouble appreciating the Ithaca chapter. I felt that an incredibly powerful moment between Stephen and Bloom was totally ruined by the incredibly dull mathematical chatechism style. I think I've read somewhere that it was Joyce's favourite episode, which sure puzzles me. Any advice on how to approach this is most welcome! I am about half way through \"Tina\" by Herman Bang. The story takes place during the Second Schleswig War, which was between Denmark and Prussia in 1864. It is about the girl Tina who is living in a small village close to where the battles are raging. She is in love with a married man who gets called up for the war, and through this story, Bang does a very fine job of describing the general atmosphere in a village, that sees the healthy and motivated soldiers going off to war and the wounded and dead being carried back. Bang's writing style has been described as impressionistic, and doesn't have a lot of digressions into the thoughts of the characters, long descriptions of landscape or anything. It is felt like a very coarse and broad description of events, where all of a sudden he mentions a small movement or sentence that just seems to carry so much emotion in it. It is all very beautiful, but a lot is going on between the lines so I might have to reread it when I'm done. I am not sure how the book would do in translation, though.  \"I think too many people approach it like a puzzle to be decoded\"\n","Do you there are any books you should read before Ulysses in order to enjoy it better?

Yep, I was right - the artist has posted [the high-res version of the art](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExhMYILWEAIiBZy?format=jpg&name=large) and you can clearly see \"wtf is up with the right-hand index finger.\" I'm on mobile and it's nowhere to be found This seems like a really odd thing for him to say, given how much frustration he's expressed about the legacy that the present-/color-shifted planar chaos cards have left.

Because independent sex workers need to have money too Thallid tokens was a draft archetype in Time Spiral block and had plenty of support.  While this card certainly isn't the best among them, it's been better than you think and I'm super excited to play it again.  Of course it doesn't look very good on its own, because you aren't also seeing any of its synergistic cards like [[Sporoloth Ancient]] or [[Sporesower Thallid]]. In the art for the [the foil Time Stop from 10th Edition](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=released&q=%21%22Time+Stop%22&unique=prints), they painted over the bird to make it a white silhouette. The inverted pentacle was never on the book, they were on his head and over his heart, and there were 5 printings of it like that before the one printing without them, before they decided to stop printing the card because it was too powerful.  If you're going to be wrong, at least be wrong correctly. What in the world does this mean? Templating should be \"As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature.\n","\n","Counter target spell with converted mana cost 5 or less.\" Thanks for the feedback!  I think most if not all cards that refer to a commander do so as \"a commander,\" \"your commander\" or \"target commander\" (see [[Flawless Maneuver]], [[Echo Storm]] or [[Forge of Heroes]]), but I do see where you're coming from in light of cards like [[Ghastly Demise]].\n","\n","Good catch on the color!  No idea how that slipped my mind.  I realized I messed up the templating for that part in several ways, too.\n","\n","I actually first concepted this as WB and switched it during the design (it did something different/not really possible at first), so you're not entirely off base there.  I think I was trying to go for the chaos that usually surrounds coups, but that's a bit high-concept to convey in a mana cost 😅 Thanks!

Godzilla's a Pixar mom now? Yes, that's exactly what I said.  You have to remember how much time it would take for all that dialogue to be read out loud, though - even if it's only a few pages that are that bad, the series as a whole has gotten much more text-heavy in this arc, and the time it takes to say all that text adds up very quickly.\n","\n","The Chimera Ant arc almost ran into this problem but it had a slew of fantastic, dynamic fight scenes to break up the tension.  Aside from Chrollo vs Hisoka, I don't think this arc has yet had any fights like that (though I could be wrong; I'm not able to glance back through it right now to check), so what we end up having is a whole bunch of dialogue that takes longer to say than the actions the characters are doing take to do.\n","\n","This isn't a problem in manga because panels are just static images and the text passes at whatever speed the reader reads it at, but in animation - a medium that exists to express movement and action - it just seems like a waste.\n","\n","I also definitely don't think a filler conclusion would be able to bring any satisfying amount of closure to the story, least of all wrapping up all the open threads it has right now. Not to mention, the current arc is so dialogue-heavy that there have been multiple pages with little to no illustrations on them beyond people talking to each other or the occasional nen beast reveal.  I'm not necessarily mad about that given Togashi's chronic illnesses, but I can't imagine it would be very fun to watch, or offer many chances to showcase the advantages that animation has. Very much so 😍 Any Abarat fans here?  I've had four copies of the first book, two of the second, and so far I've managed not to lose my copy of the third.

Apparently he uses both for Twitch and Smite, if you look on twitch thats his same name and on Smite it matches it 100%. So no question. That's 100% BullSh** I feel like Stoenr should lose his mod privileges just for trying to throw his power around that!! It's so unprofessional!! Why would Smite even allow some one even remotely related to them allow something like this?

I don't know if I want to laugh or cry now.\n","\n","I didn't really think about it.  I just did it like I would to any adult (yes I'm horrible).\n","\n","But it was epic.  Never seen a child yell so loud or go screaming so fast. It is legal to carry a gun (revolver or pistol) into FEDERAL parks and forests as of a few years ago when the law changed.  You don't even need a concealed carry permit.\n","\n","For state park and state forests it's going to depend on the individual state laws.  A quick google search should let you know.\n","\n","However, if you are going to carry I would suggest getting a permit because a lot of times the state and federal lands are very \"intermingled\".  You may have a hard time staying on a trail without going from one jurisdiction to the other.\n","\n","If you had to buy just 1 gun for everything and you live on the east coast I would tell you to either get a:\n","\n","1) Snub nose 357 revolver.  Enough power for black bears and small enough to conceal...and I'd load regular 38 special HP for home defense and hard-cast (non-expanding) 357 magnum for bear protection, and you could also set it up where the first round is shot for snake.  In the case of bear or human attack just fire through the shot real fast to get to the powerful load that comes next.\n","\n","OR\n","\n","2) A Glock 29.  It's the compact version of the Glock 20.  It's chambered in 10mm.  Power ranges from very light 40 cal levels for home defense and personal protection to almost 357 pressures for woods protection.  You lose the ability to load shot for snakes but gain more rounds even in the compact 29.  10 rounds compared to 5 or 6 with the revolver.\n","\n","If you had to buy 1 gun for everything...I would go with one of those.  GL.  Hit me back with any more questions you have.

I generally oppose more gun laws based on the premise that I *prioritize freedom over safety*.\n","\n","It's an imperfect world.  Guns were invented hundreds of years ago and they aren't going away.  You can't *unring* that bell.\n","\n","So, I think it's important to place as few barriers as possible between law-abiding citizens and their protection.\n","\n","I also believe that the media hypes up gun crime to the point that it skews the issue.  A good example would be the \"assault weapons\" which are almost never used in crimes, statistically provide almost no threat, but always come under attack.\n","\n","Finally, there are a lot of laws we don't enforce like we should now (I can attest to that) which leads me to believe that the ability of criminals to get guns after new laws will be very little effected, only leaving law-abiding citizens at greater risk.\n","\n","Oh, and I really do believe in the idea of an armed population to resist government tyranny.  Most of the world was still run by monarchs 100 years ago (before WW1), Hitler existed 2 generations ago.  Stalin existed 2 generations ago.   The Soviet Union only fell 30 years ago.  There are still places all over this world where people live under tyranny.  I think it's naive to believe it can't ever happen in the US.\n","\n","> 2) In which state are you?\n","\n","I'd rather not say, but I live in the Southeast US.\n","\n","> 3) Do you know of any places in the US where I, as a foreign civilian, can shoot fully automatic rifles at a shooting range?\n","\n","Shooting a fully automatic rifle is not going to be much more difficult for a foreigner than a citizen, because it's illegal for both of us to own them (without lots of red tape).\n","\n","However you can RENT AND SHOOT even as a foreigner I believe.\n","\n","There is a big place in Las Vegas that has lots for rent I think, but there are ranges all over the US that rent fully auto guns.  Google ranges in your area and call them up and ask to find out. I've given this a lot of thought and I think the lifestyle you had is much more pleasant and practical in the North than the South.\n","\n","For example, in the winter you can chop wood to stay warm.  It might be unpleasant but it works and you can dress warmer. In the summer it's pleasant and mild.\n","\n","In the South, the winter is pleasant and mild, but the summers are INSUFFERABLE and there is literally nothing you can do to avoid it except pay $$$ for electric air conditioning.  You can only get so naked.\n","\n","If we were ever forced to live in some post-normal society where nobody had electricity, I would be in hell where I live.\n","\n"," Black widows up in MT?  Escaping some of the creepy-crawlies is one of the reasons I want to move North and West.  Living in the SE we are lousy with horrible critters of every kind. Just curious, but why would you need to boil water to *wash*?  I obviously understand the need to boil water to drink and cook, but to wash with? I live on the east coast and it can still cost many thousands of dollars to get electricity to an undeveloped area.  You can be surrounded by lines and it doesn't matter.  The give you X feet for free and charge Y per foot past that.  It doesn't matter if it's coming from the road, the property line, or the next town away.\n","\n","I was going to buy a little place surrounded by State Forest until I learned it was going to cost me $12k or $15k to get lines out.  It really ruined the good deal I was going to get and I backed out. > My family ended up renting an office in town since my parents were self-employed running a paper\n","\n","I may be reading that wrong, but are you saying that your parents worked as journalist running a periodical but lived without electricity? It's very dependent on person and situation, but in most cases a semi-auto pistol is better.\n","\n","A pistol is more complex to operate, but becomes very easy with practice...and imho nobody should own and use a gun AT ALL unless they practice with it anyway.\n","\n","A revolver is better in only a few specific circumstances.  A revolver with an internal hammer (called hammerless) has no external moving parts, neither the slide nor the hammer.  So, it can be fired from inside a purse or a jacket pocket.  There is nothing that can bind up and keep it from operating and also nothing that can snag when drawing it.  That's a benefit, but only for a pretty specific scenario.\n","\n","Revolvers are also best for woods-protection.  Large bears and other wildlife need considerably more firepower than 2-legged attackers.  Most of the calibers suitable for woods-protection are only offered in revolvers (except for ridiculous handguns like Desert Eagles than don't work for carrying in the woods).\n","\n","Exceptions to this would be things like 10mm Auto and few other relatively unknowns, but that's really only enough stopping power for east coast wildlife.\n","\n","For concealed carry, pistols are slimmer and easier to conceal.  For home defense you don't want something terribly powerful due to over penetration through drywall, so capacity trumps power - which again gives a nod to a pistol.\n","\n","So, basically, except for woods protection I would go with a semi-auto pistol.  If you want further details or recommendations just let me know. The landscape is very realistic but the characters are not at all.  Don't get me wrong...they look great.  Very high quality, curved, and smooth.  But they don't fit.  Way too clean and \"cartoon\" looking imho. Look up at the moon.  That was the moon about 1 second ago.\n","\n","The speed of light is roughly 1ft per nanosecond.   1000000000 nanoseconds in 1 second.  1000000000 ft/5280 = 189,000 miles\n","\n","Distance from earth to moon = 238,900 miles.\n","\n","So, it takes 1.23 seconds for the image of moon you see to reach earth.  So if an alien was on the moon and sneezed, you might miss it.\n"," My favorite gun is probably my M40A5 with an 8-32 power Nightforce scope. In the store or in my personal collection? That's kind of an interesting point.\n","\n","I can refuse to sell a gun to someone for any reason whatsoever.  This is the one area where the government is totally okay with you refusing to service to ANYONE for ANY REASON.\n","\n","\"He gave me a weird feeling\" is 100% acceptable reason to stop a gun transaction according to the Feds.\n","\n","However, the store will simply find another employee in the department to complete the transaction if you don't have some solid reason to deny the sale.  They want their money.\n","\n","If the customer appears to be drunk/high, acting aggressive, involved in a straw purchase etc, then I am supposed to tell them outright why I am denying them a sale (awkward) and put them in our computer so they can't go to another store and start the transaction over.  I've done this many times.\n","\n","However, when I just get a bad feeling about someone because they are asking strange questions or seem in a big hurry to get a gun without caring what kind....I usually just try to discourage them by being completely 100% unhelpful and rude.  I just try to make buying a gun from me more trouble than it's worth.\n","\n","I do that pretty often. Yes.  Many times. They have two policies depending on the type of circumstances.\n","\n","1) The store allows concealed carry like many businesses in this region, so anyone can carry in the store as long as they have a Concealed Weapons Permit and it remains concealed.\n","\n","2) Anyone who wants to have a gun worked on, a scope attached, or  check holster sizes, etc must check their gun at the podium at the front of the store and then they call over the intercom for an employee to walk the gun back to my counter. \n","8247 My grandma used to put eyelid tape on me when I was little before going to church...

I find trying to write notes in the margins slows me down too much when reading unless I'm really trying to analyze it. I feel that. Last semester I had a physics assignment due BEFORE the first day of class like wtf I think short would look great! I would try supplementing with magnesium in the evenings for constipation. It works wonders for me How would you even use this without flashing your whole ass to everyone in the bathroom? Yeah I love it! I did a double course the first time I took it to help kickstart reversing my dysbiosis. Now I only take a single course when I have to take a round of antibiotics (as a last resort for UTIs) and it to work great at reversing and digestive issues that arise. Yeah honestly I never noticed any side effects like that while taking it. I think the capsule they use must not release until your large intestine so there’s no painful fermentation in your stomach or small intestine. My biggest gut issues were bloating and gas when I ate a lot of different foods (the worst was veggies and gluten but really it happened every time I ate). Now I hardly ever get the same discomfort I used to get and can enjoy all those foods again. It’s been over a month and I still feel great. Like I said I’ve never felt the same results while taking an expensive daily probiotic. It definitely helped with my bloating and bad digestion! Since you’re case is so severe I’d recommend taking 2 courses back to back and making sure to eat plenty of prebiotic veggies during and after the 12 days :) I always take 1-2 courses of  [Elixa ](https://www.elixa-probiotic.com/) probiotics after having to take antibiotics. It’s the only probiotic I’ve ever taken that I feel like actually makes a difference with my digestion. It's when they let cows eat grass for the first part of their lives and then fatten them up on grain right before slaughter. It's cheaper and they can still label it as \"grass fed\" solved solved solved Oh my gosh yes that's it! Thank you! so basically savory almond butter?

I find it pretty hard to make lower body progress with bodyweight only exercises. Yep! That comes from excess acetone in your urine, sweat, blood, etc., as your body learns how to burn fat efficiently. After you become fat adapted in a few weeks it will go away. I would really recommend focusing on developing a strong and steady kick. People often neglect this aspect by focusing entirely on the arms and head. Maybe try practice by kicking with a kickboard to develop some strength and coordination before incorporating it into your freestyle. As a former competitive swimmer, the people who say swimming is too low intensity to burn significant calories aren't working hard enough. \n","8251 And thing  Indian man is going to fuck us God I hope this is ironic Fuck off you normie cunt Me Poopy butthole but I will miss noob noobs god damns Kinky No they don't Well r/dankmemes is no longer dank all there is so this shit there is normie s everywhere and it seems that we can't do anything about it What the fuck is this shit this isn't dank at all Nice meme, no homo I think we're good because you can't spell adver(ti)semen(ts) without semen in between the tits  This has been around for a long time the next part is: go ahead and try to sue I have money up the wall zoo  This is gold But that's not as funny  --- Fuck them in the ass She should have also brought a rifle Ya I agree her last show was a Blast \n","8252 Hey folks!

I'm not sure my retirement account will allow me to withdraw funds, The last time I spoke with them they told me that they only allow withdrawals for medical expenses, not for time missed for work due to medical conditions, but I will call them tomorrow and see if there is another option.  Thanks for the advice :) Is there an advantage to actually showing up for my court date then if they will just enter a judgement anyway?   I will be missing an unpaid day of work to appear and a friend of mine said it is not even worth it to show up for a judgement case you know you are guilty of. The only assets I have is about $2500 in a 401B and my car which is worth $8000.   I will try to contact the collection agency.   I am really trying to avoid a judgement on my credit. Thank you.

I’m just trying to advocate for people who may not want to WFH forever, it’s not an either or thing. Or it shouldn’t be.\n","\n","I’m literally advocating for everyone to have the option they find best suits them, including people like you who may never want to return to the office. I acknowledged that this article did well in stating that not everyone is suited for working from home, and I still like that this article is in favor of flexible schedules and/or companies providing the option to work from home if wanted. Something many WFH advocating articles haven’t done. Both are things that I am also in favor of if that wasn’t clear from my initial statement. \n","\n","“... imagine trying to convince business executives to open back up the offices so people can escape their violent spouses. If this seems insensitive I apologize.”\n","\n","This is insensitive but it’s all good. I’m not sure where you work or what industry, but the area I work in and most of my friends who work in similar/other industries, many of their companies, mine included, value work life balance and employee satisfaction to a higher degree than other factors, as far as keeping their employees happy and decreasing turnovers. Recent studies even show that millennials and Gen Z choose overall work life balance and satisfaction over monetary compensation and I think companies are starting to pay attention and apply this. Obviously I say this from my perspective, but in my mind I think companies would be more open to offering flex schedules or WFH and/or office options if they were able to see from EVERY PERSPECTIVE why alternate schedules or providing all employees the option to work from home or at the office is beneficial for ALL employees, especially if employee satisfaction is what many companies are aiming for. Hate to be “that guy” but I feel like these “working from home is better” articles are always grossly oversimplified. I like that this article is at least fair in acknowledging that 1) we should offer flex schedules or work from home options and 2) extroverts don’t acclimate well to remote work but there are plenty of other individuals outside of that spectrum who wouldn’t acclimate well either. It isn’t a coincidence that since working from home, there has been a rise in depression, domestic abuse, and child abuse. I speak from experience that my only solace from my abusers was when they left the home and went to work. Fortunately, I got hired 6 months into the pandemic and moved into a place of my own, but my heart goes out to the individuals who don’t have that choice or ability because I was in their position at one point too and it was utter hell. I wanted to die everyday.\n","\n","Working from home is great for a lot of people but it seems like many of these articles are purposefully leaving out the unfortunate realities working from home has brought on for many families and individuals. Like can we normalize discussing actual pros AND cons of remote and in office work instead of all of these “we should NEVER go back to the office and here’s 3 reasons why” articles? The click bait article titles (and often times the articles themselves only mention positives?) do a ton of damage IMO by speaking on behalf of everyone when the the reality is working from home might have worked out great for YOU, but it hasn’t for tons of other people. \n","\n","Discussing the reality of the situation would be a more compelling argument as to why companies should offer flex schedules too, rather than just going with the whole “it’s better to work from home just because it is” argument.

My mom works with Kanye and I was shocked when she told me he’s actually really soft spoken, shy, and a really really nice dude Well said, and I’m glad I was able to spread at least some light on all of this. I will say this though, while I agree that the Republican Party/the right is not known for championing for equality, the Democratic Party/the left has done little for equality too imo. Let’s be real, neither of them give a shit. It’s just two sides of the same coin.\n","\n","This is why I left the far left and have become more center left and moderate over the years because:\n","\n","1) I support ideas, not people, and I have found myself agreeing with more of the right stances \n","\n","2) the left has disappointed me again and again with their hypocrisy and lack of action (for example: cities like Seattle, LA, SF, NY, are plagued with a serious homeless problem, and despite these states being notoriously blue, they have done close to nothing to alleviate this issue, but this is a pattern I have seen continuously from the left, like how Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, is against inequality allegedly and is “for the people”, yet accepts payouts from Wall Street executives to do speeches, likewise, her and her daughter live in multi-million dollar penthouses in NY, and only spend time with the elite, because nothing says I care about inequality like commingling with the very people you claim perpetuate it) \n","\n","And 3) I think the left wing politicians have become too easily influenced and swayed by social media idiots, even to the point that they are willing to compromise basic rights like free speech\n","\n","That being said, I know the Republicans aren’t the good guys either. So centrists like me are basically having ceaseless internals battles about “what shitty chore I like the most” basically. I have never gone on that subreddit so idk what goes on in there but if that’s the case then I obviously don’t agree with them doing that and agree with you that it’s probably an echo chamber, but all I’m saying is that that goes for the left too. That’s my whole point with “everyone is so polarized” it’s literally EVERYONE. Not just Republicans. I’m literally a part of “the left” and I see it just as much here. Honestly, just take everything at face value. Not everything the left says or does is right or true. Not everything the right says or does is right or true. Why could that be?: I’m sorry to say, but it’s due to ignorance. The Republican Party isn’t some monolith of ideas that all people within the party agree with. I say the same in defense of the Democratic Party too: not all Democrats are non-binary, gender queers, who hate men and want socialism. I’m personally a Democrat myself, and align most closely with Obama’s policies and political views, but even I think it’s wildly irresponsible to assume that 1 person represents the values and ideals of 150 million people. That’s why I say there is nuance in political alignment. You getting downvoted literally proves how polarized we’ve all become in our political ways. Republican automatically = racist and bad apparently, forgetting completely about many perfectly fine republicans like John McCain, Mitt Romney, etc. \n","\n","I’m center left but I have friends from every political avenue and I know now that there’s nuance and great variation when it comes to political alignment. \n","\n","The world isn’t black or white but the media and a majority of the people treat it like it is. I guarantee most of the people “eating it up” are political moderates like myself. I’m center left but the amount of hate and vitriol I’ve seen from the majority of those on the left and and even the BLM organization itself has gotten to the point that I can no longer support the organization at all. The original message and motives I’ll still stand with because black lives DO matter, but sorry not sorry I do not stand with Black Lives Matter TM. You’re trying to be like Ben Shapiro except you’re not and additionally you’re lacking a law degree from Harvard. Even Shapiro acknowledged that he would call Blaire a She because there’s a utility to pronouns too, which he recognized. Y’all say all lives matter he says no lives matter I agree that pointing out societal problems doesn’t warrant a “then leave our country” response, but I have to say, even in instances where the person was complaining profusely and even threatened(?) to leave if “XYZ happens” or if “XYZ doesn’t change”, still hasn’t left. And I’m not talking about the average Joe, because we all know Joe isn’t going to uproot his life and family and move to another country because of financial and social reasons/obligations and restrictions.\n","\n","BUT, even when a person who has money or is a wealthier member of American society has said they would leave the US, they still haven’t left. This is evident with when Donald Trump won Presidency and ever other celebrity was “threatening” to leave the US if Trump won (i.e.: Jennifer Lawrence, Samuel L. Jackson, Lena Dunham, Chelsea Handler, Snoop Dogg, etc.). Guess what happened? They’re all still here. I bargain that a great majority of the people who claim they would leave today, wouldn’t actually even if they had the financial means to. Can you elaborate on how small mom and pop business owners have been “destroying your community for decades and centuries”? Why do you keep going back to the “but hugs aren’t sexual or creepy” argument and glossing over the kissing and touching? We get it, hugs aren’t inherently creepy or sexual but the hugging isn’t the main problem here... he’s fondling women inappropriately and I know plenty of women, self included, who have been “offended” by unwanted kissing and touching. The big problem rn is that there aren’t enough tests to test everyone in the US, that’s why state governments are starting to push for social distancing and self quarantining and why access to COVID-19 tests are limited. This isn’t just the US or the US government tho. One of my best friends is studying in dental school in Taiwan, she got sick but was also not tested for COVID-19 because they were only testing those who displayed major symptoms (fever, coughing, shortness of breath), or those who had come back from China; but unless you had those “prerequisites” you weren’t tested. \n","\n","I do still think that it’s complete bullshit that they would test CeLeBriTiEs or ImPoRtAnt PeOpLe showing no signs of the virus’ infection, but are not allowing testing on those they KNOW are high risk. But until we have enough COVID-19 testing kits you’re right, practice social distancing for fucks sake. It boggles my mind that people still aren’t practicing it. There was one nice day in LA a few days back and EVERYONE was out and about; selfishness at its best, it makes me sick (no pun intended). I’m sorry but this makes me think of that spongebob episode where Mr. Krabs gets a phone call from the children’s hospital asking for donations and he responds with “why what have children ever done for me” lol Yeah my mom’s side of my family sounds like your dad’s side of the family and it was a MESS. Good on you for choosing to stay away from the drama (when big money is involved it gets out of control Jesus Christ). Also your mom’s side sounds amazing! It’s extremely demeaning. Like they don’t think about the fact that our parents might have instilled really great values in us despite our background. I was taught that hard work and integrity is important no matter what your socioeconomic status is. My parents did not give me “hand outs”, and if I get to where I want to be it’s because I earned it. Are you me?? This sounds exactly like my situation and it’s so frustrating... especially with the “bougie” or “spoilt” insult, a lot of it honestly wasn’t in my control. My parents enjoyed stereotypical high street activities before I was even born, and I can’t really help that that’s what they did with me and my brother growing up, like ofc that’s the lifestyle I would prefer or be used to because it’s familiar to me! Yeah I think a lot of my friends and peers have been surprised when I tell them that there’s a lot that my “rich” parents can’t do for me that I need to do or earn myself. It’s frustrating too because anyone I talk to seems to be under the impression that throwing money at anything will make everything ok and give you whatever you need but that hasn’t been the case for me at all. This is the worst... no one gives me credit or sympathy when I’m going through my own problems. I’ve been having a really hard time finding my first job after college, and the past year has been nothing short of panic attacks, crippling depression and anxiety, and unidentifiable health issues with my head/neck but anyone I talk to literally just tells me to ask my parents to give me a job and ignores anything else I tell them, like that will solve all my problems... My parents are self made too and I thank my parents (my dad mostly) for keeping me grounded and passing on his values onto me and my brother. Even with all the problems I’ve had making true friends, I’m glad my parents at least kept us grounded enough to be able to socially function with people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. This happened to my uncle’s car ALL THE TIME. People keyed his car or used it to put out their cigarettes... awful treatment no matter how rich or poor you are. \n","8258 Thank you very much sir. I'm glad I found your post because I thought I was going to lose my mind as to how to deal with our situation. I appreciate your post and the best of luck to yall.  I guess I should've read your last comment so disregard my comment. I will see how our situation progresses and contact our state health insurance commissioner if needed. Thank you for your post. Hello I see this post is a few months old but am hoping for a response as I'm currently going through the same situation. As of today we spent all day going back and forth with our health insurance provider and health care marketplace. Everything that you have stated has been much of our same experience within this one day of dealing with both parties and by the looks of it we might not get anything resolved within the near future. My girlfriends insurance was \"retroactively\" canceled as stated by health care marketplace on the date that was prior to our child's birth while we were in the hospital during her induced labor as she tried to add our child to her policy a few days ago.None of this makes sense to us either and I couldn't be more furious and aggravated as to how this  problem can not be fixed much easier. As of right now we are only getting the run around between both parties. I would like to see how your problem has progressed or been resolved for any advice possible or discuss further via email or offline.

Yea i tried rebooting aswell, didn't do anything, tried tweeting massive but didn't get a reply (yet at least). On top of the budget issues, there were certain things the Director of MGO3 was not willing to do because it went against his vision, removing classes was one of em. Take your pent-up anger with him.\n","\n","If you need further proof for this then just look at the rules of the game modes, we worked hard to get em to change them towards what worked in MGO2 (5 bases to capture, all neutral bases at start, no stealth camo on defenders etc) but these were also things they were unwilling to change similarly to the no classes suggestion.\n","\n","Instead of telling Konami what they failed at you're here raging at people who dedicated their free time to improving a game that was honestly dead on arrival. But i dont think you understand anything about how game development works so i'll just leave it at that. You're probably the most miserable person in the entire world and absolutely the saltiest in the entire MGO community. You're literally going around downvoting and shitting on anything i say or anything i post with some grudge you've been holding onto for a whole year!\n","\n","You fail to realize that the team who handled MGO3 was on very limited budget and only able to make small tiny changes to tweak things after release. This was common knowledge and they said even before release that \"they'd have to see how much or if anything can be changed\". There was no point to demand for them to remove the classes from the game because they didn't have money or the manpower to make such drastic changes for the game. Konami simply did not provide the team with much of a budget or much of a team for post release support. \n","\n","The community project we did was based around ideas that could be done with minimal effort and the small budget they were working with. You are delusional if you think the changes they ended up making didn't improve the game. Sure it was not enough in hindsight to save the game but it was never gonna be enough because of how bad of a shape the game was released in originally.\n","\n","Now go back to the cave of misery you crawled up from, i've never once seen you say anything positive in response to anything or anyone. Yep i'm always gonna say how it is and no amount of bribes or whatever can change that. What do we have in life if we do not stay true to ourselves and our beliefs for whats right and wrong? If our opinion can be bought then to any real fan our opinion does not matter anymore.\n","\n","MGO3 was a disaster in the eyes of nearly every dedicated MGO2 player and Metal Gear Survive from the trailer at least looks to continue that same downward trend. PES 2017 however is excellent so Konami at least on that front improved one franchise with things that people actually wanted. There's no rule restricting us to only stream Konami games. The others are often streaming other games aswell. But dedication towards Konami titles helps one get into K-Code i suppose. lolol never gonna happen :D no worries :) been a part of K-Code since the day they started it. Mainly streaming Overwatch at the moment. The competitive mode on it is the closest u'll ever get to MGO2 survival on another game! Hope you guys enjoy it, i'm still part of Konami's KCode streaming team and i'll begin streaming Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 soon (along with more Overwatch). The things you listed like creating the twitter accounts and subreddits are a bare minimum of what a community manager does/handles these days. The MGO preview event was highly frowned upon with all of its embargos etc. How about doing another one now with the devs and top players present so we can actually have a day to discuss and argue why certain things need changing/adding? You invited social media junkies to the last one, there weren't any top players present. It was all about getting free controlled publicity for the game.\n","\n","The thing that you must understand is that its completely fine to tell people that \"thank you for the suggestion, i will forward it to the dev team\" in public rather than have them wait for months while they're all on the brink of giving up on the game. You don't always need to have a sure answer for everything. People like to know they are getting heard. If you always wait until you know if something will be fixed to announce it then ur gonna spend months in silence and people lose hope.\n","\n","And yes speaking actively on this sub that you seemingly had a part in creating would be a good start. Ben <3 How are classic modes not fast to add in comparison to content that has to be created from scratch including the time and money that goes into creating new ideas? If you removed Fultons and gave each team 1 side of the map that would be TDM already. Then you could add regular Deathmatch by simply removing the teams. Boom that's 2 new modes and some much needed content with minimum effort (in comparison to creating new fresh ideas).\n","\n","It is not only me who has lost interest in MGO, all major teams around the globe (at least North America/Europe) have quit. Look at the participant numbers on Survival. The most popular mode on MGO2 has less than 100 people playing worldwide 2 months after it's release. Now remember that Survival/Tournaments single-handedly kept people playing MGO2 for 4 years.\n","\n","I don't question your passion for MGS or things related to it, i am simply saying you need to be more active in a transparent way in the community.\n","\n","Also i'd like to note that Konami has been totally wrong in analysing MGO2 and thinking it was a game for ppl who had hardcore devotion towards it. It was loved by nearly everybody who ever touched it. The reason it seemed to become a game for hardcore devotees was because Konami allowed glitchers to ruin the game for everybody and took over a year to adress the issues. By the time the patch finally came, everybody but the hardcore had abandoned the game. Yea that's why none of the new customization items require people to download anything. The game is dying yet for some reason we're given 1 new item a week/every few weeks out of stuff that's been on the disc since launch. It's nothing but the team artificially trying to expand the lifecycle of the game without actually doing much work. A very common thing that plagues the game on PS4 is that even if you only use 2 Torbjorns on Defense and the Attacking team loses (which happens all the time...) They will retaliate with 3-6 Torbjorns on their Defense round because they are so frustrated. Their teamwork could be totally crap but it still becomes nearly impossible to win. I'm also starting to see a new trend emerging that people will stick around for their defense round and then quit the game so they won't have to play the attacking round against the people they just cheesed (cos they feel/know the 6 Torbjorn retaliation is coming). This won't work as a fix against multiple torbjorns. Mainly because you get scrap from any dead enemies that your allies killed too. You don't need to participate in the fighting at all to get scrap. Adding a 10 second cooldown that kicks in after the turret is destroyed would be a much better way. Also limiting the angle it can turn in would be good. People have mics (hell one comes with each xbox/ps4), the problem is that if you're in a party (most ppl are) then it blocks the randoms from hearing em. I really wish Blizzard would have left the text chat into the console versions. Exactly, they've been glitching the entire community for 4 and a half months straight and Konami has not acted whatsoever even though they get reported with video evidence all the time... Yep this is another thing that is so amazing to me. Those Maojin guys and their friend DarioG88 DDoS'd the servers for months and glitched ppl endlessly and even when we sent videos to Konami about it, they never did anything to get rid of them. When they first started glitching in the beginning of February we sent Peeler's team an email saying those guys should be permabanned from the game because they have so many PSN accounts that they'll just be back the next day from any temp ban. Apparently they are still on the game doing it and it's June now. That's not the point, i was on the private mailing lists between selected players and Konami working towards making the game better together so i know Peeler has forwarded some of our stuff to the devs. That's not the only thing a community manager is supposed to do though. He has not been active in the community at all, he has barely replied anyone when asked about anything. How has Peeler improved the games community? How has he communicated with the fanbase? How much effort has be put in to ease the minds of the players who were experiencing problems in the game. How would you rate his activity when it comes to exchanging words and ideas with the playerbase?\n","\n","A good community manager has to do way more than just pass a couple of ideas to the devs from the shadows. I'm not blaming him for the changes not happening, i know he's not in charge of what gets added to the game and what doesn't but he absolutely did not do the job that a community manager is required to do in a professional gaming company in this day and age. It's the community managers job to be transparent with the community, to take part in the community by communicating with us. Yet he's been a ghost since MGO3 came out. The community gave em our wishes way before the game came out, if any of it had been passed to development then MGO3 wouldn't have been the disaster it became. I'm sure Peeler has passed suggestions to the development team but that doesn't count as being a good community manager. Go check what the community managers are doing at Blizzard or Bungie and how active they are with replying the community and communicating to their fans. How many people in this community can honestly say they've received a reply from Peeler when they asked something?\n","\n","Ben who worked maintaining Konami's twitter account did 10 times more for the games community and that was not his job at all to do so. That says alot about what a helluva job Peeler did as the community manager. I don't doubt that he's a fan of MGS and cares but that doesn't mean he did a good job as the community manager and that is my point.\n","\n","Many indie games are supported better than what MGO3 received from Konami post-launch. The problem is not how much it costs, the problem is how damn little Konami was willing to invest in their community. They hoped MGO3 would be a cash cow for them by doing the bare minimum so they could abandon it as soon as the micro-transactions run dry, that's the sad reality of it all.\n","\n","What really must be criticized is that while Konami fixed some major bugs here and there post-launch, they never were willing to touch the modes in the game. The community cried and cried for months how the spawns were broken in Bounty Hunter, how bases should be increased and how they should be neutral in Comm Control and how stealth camo shouldn't be allowed on the defending team on Cloak and Dagger... These are just small examples of the some of the core problems within those launch modes and they were never adressed. We asked for classic modes to make returns from MGO2 (the modes that made MGO so beloved in the past) which are very simple and fast to add to the game yet again we were ignored.\n","\n","All of MGO communitys core clans have abandoned the game as have all the casuals who the game was obviously targeted for. Look at the amount of players Survival has on MGO3 (the most popular mode by far in MGO2). They finally gave it to us but just like everything else we asked for (that we received) they released it broken and half-assed and took away all the reasons why we were so addicted to it back in 2008-2012. Great community manager Peeler? What exactly has he done that's so great? MGO3 failed because the community's wishes were not respected at all during development or after it. Konami did the bare minimum to support the game after launch only because they hoped to sell more microtransactions to us by making it seem the game was being supported. The ugly truth is that a majority of things that were added to the game were already on the disc since launch and it was simply unlocked for us (Medals, Sabotage, Customization items etc). I'm saying this as respectfully as i can too, me and my clan played this game from October-March til we finally had enough. Yea 1-2 turrets can be managed with Widows, Junkrats, Pharahs and Reinhardts but 3 turrets or more becomes a pain if the Torbjörn players know what they are doing and put the turrets in tricky places on opposite sides of the room behind their whole team etc. All this becomes extra infuriating when played with randoms who you can't communicate with lol Thats the main reason those turrets need nerfing, u can take em down but u'll still lose the game.. Are you saying barely anyone plays as Torbjörn on PC? Could be why Blizzard hasn't talked about any nerfs for the turrets yet :/ D.Va and Zarya work sure against 1 or 2 turrets (when the turrets are all in close proximity). But yea the turret has 40 meter range and 360 degree angle and when placed in multiples to the opposite sides of the room then good luck against it. Play against 6 turrets wielded by skilled players and you'll see. Play with randoms too and you'll understand. Tons of teams on consoles take 3-6 turrets (especially after they lose to u) and those matches are easily the most frustrating thing on Overwatch. Not so much because the turrets are hard to destroy but because it takes so much time when there's multiple turrets and Torbjörn can simply put another turret elsewhere instantly as soon as the first one is destroyed.

I will always support the right to speak your mind without legal repercussions, but social consequences are inevitable and often warranted as the only real tool to change the behavior of those we strongly disagree with or whose words we find harmful to society. At the end of the day, we each have a right to decide what that looks like for us. Some of the response I see, I find counterproductive to discussion and ideally persuasion. That said, hate speech and toxic viewpoints need to be called out for what they are and those who espouse them will inevitably suffer the consequences. This thread has given me a lot to think about and I think I need some time to revise and clarify my stance. **Δ**\n","\n","Thanks for your response. As I mentioned to another commenter, I'm realizing that I need to clarify my viewpoint. I believe that free speech carries consequences and that no one person gets to decide what that looks like. Just as American's have the right to free speech, people, companies, and organizations all have to right to disinvest and not support causes or people that they disagree with. I think my real issue is with where to draw the line in regards to social punishment of those who espouse views that I disagree with or find toxic. There's a lot of gray area and every situation merits a different response. I personally try to vote with my dollar (and of course with my actual vote) and support companies and groups that use their influence to do the same. I just worry about a culture where even discussion (not overt hate speech) of controversial topics becomes taboo. This has given me a lot to think about and I think I need time to digest these responses and qualify my own stance. \n","\n","And 100% agreed regarding wearing masks.

As I said, I stand behind the idea that free speech carries consequences and support many of the actions you listed in response to speech I find incompatible with my own beliefs. I'm realizing now that my position on this issue has more so to do with what I see as revenge motivated attempts to personally harm someone for their beliefs than consequences as a whole. For example, companies can and sometimes should fire employees for speech that is antithetical to their values and values of their customers. They, just like individuals, have the option to not invest their time, money, or resources in supporting someone they disagree with. I myself try to vote with my dollar and time whenever possible. I suppose my real issue is with where to draw the line and clearly that line is nebulous and unique to every situation. It would depend if the context is relevant. Do I believe it should be illegal to shout \"fire!\" in a crowded theater? Of course. But there are few if any situations where I would say someone should be forbidden from stating something publicly. I may vehemently disagree with them, but I respect their right to say it.

I can't remember what bar it was that had it but it was super trippy and fun. No worries! We did smoke, I am a daily toker at home and Amsterdam's stuff had me on my ass after about 4 big hits. Be careful, it creeps up on you! I found my personally sweet spot was 1-2 hits about every half hour. Enough to make everything delightful, but not so much that I was a drooling idiot. Haha the food isn't too spendy, thankfully the place we were staying had a kitchen that everyone could use so we cooked our own meal at least once a day and took advantage of as much free breakfast as we could get!  Our experience in Amsterdam was amazing and so far out of all of the places we have gone it is my favorite place.  We started off in Amsterdam, went down to Rome then up to Vienna and then Munich.

The first will be your finances book. At the start of your trip, write down the total amount in your bank account. Take notes on travel expenses, souvenirs etc. that way you can keep track of your money easily.   The second notebook should have your travel info. Make meticulous notes on where you're staying, any big travel steps etc. for example, we put our train info in, we marked the trains, times, directions to and from the train stations from where we are staying. The addresses of our hostiles, we used it also as kind of a daily log, so that we could mark any big sight seeing events in there so we don't overbook ourselves.  We have a third misc. notebook that we put peoples addresses in for post cards and kept track of the souvenirs that we purchased for people, but that isn't \"essential.\"\n","\n","My next piece of advice is to get a \"document bag\" we used a fold up travel makeup bag for this and it is the best thing we have ever spent our money on.  We keep our train tickets, receipts, the above mentioned notebooks, pens, pamphlets from places we've been in etc. in there. It's all nice and organized and everything that we need is at our fingertips so we aren't fumbling at the airport or train stations. \n","\n","My last big piece of advice is to take down days.

I have the current version of the software as far as I can tell (1.0.3) and have tried updating multiple times to make sure.  I reached out to Ubisoft support directly via the support website as well as twice via twitter and have not gotten any response or updates from my opened support case in over a week.  How long does it typically take for them to respond to cases?  Is there any other way I can expedite the process of having this issue addressed?  I love the little bit of the game I've played so far, but it's very frustrating that I haven't been able to play in over a week because of game content being unavailable to me, even though it was supposed to be addressed in the last patch to my understanding.  Additionally, my game isn't letting me interact with other characters (researchers and miners don't respond when I press Y to interact with them, the typical dialogue, including audio AND subtitles don't trigger when I defeat outlaws, etc.).  Do you have any advice?  It's clearly not just an audio issue, because it's audio AND subtitles when it comes to the dialogue and my audio and subtitles were working just fine for the first couple of days I was playing.

I was emotionally numb for a number of years.  Then I found this anime and while sad, I felt something again.  It allowed me to get my emotions out that had been bottled up for years.  I was going down a dark path and I feel that this anime saved my life. So there is a lot of outcry about this and i'm not sure if anyone has wrote about it.  The reason for this is because unfortunately a synthetic drug, most likely k2 is being sprayed on the inmates letters and then shipped to them.  A lot of guards have reported getting sick after coming in contact with the letters.  I've seen things written below like prisoner are not able to get written mail anymore or limited but that isn't true.  They are still going to get their mail but it is going to be photocopied first so they won't get the originals.  There is a lot of controversy over this as it does impede privacy between inmates and their attorneys.  So these tablets are not a perfect solution but it is not a perfect situation for either side.  I'm afraid of the opposite.  I don't want to live a long life of misery and depression.  I think about how my life used to be and know that I can't get back to the way it was.  I was happy once and all I want now is my eternal rest.  My problem with going to therapy is I have no desire to feel better.  I want to be sad.  It doesn't feel right to be happy without her here.

Fellow discus/hammer thrower here,\n","The only thing I can see as that much different from our training is your volume. 10 sets of oly lifts that end with 3 at 90% seems high to me. We usually progress at 4@50%, 3@60%, 3@70% then usually one of your working sets as the workout. But we follow that up with a squat, bench, or RDL. We also do the full ROM if capable, it helps flexibility and leads to greater numbers. As far as additional exercises RDLs are a MUST. They really help your pull and overall lower back strength, we usually set its max at 80% of our back squat or our front squat max. Also throwing in some pause front squats help tremendously with getting out of the hole when and if you decide to try to learn how to catch your lifts at the bottom. \n","Hope this helps!

But no, all steaks are from the UK.  touche  it doesn't have the same effect when you read it with a Dr. Evil voice though... Definitely 100 spoon sized weathermen. IM tall and could just kick and step on them :) I guess the only reason is the due to the amoount of pubs we get deals from food companies. That and one of the basic wetherspoons values is being an affordable pub to as many people as possible.  I really like the chicken strips, they're probably my favorite. The pitchers have two double in them, so 100ml. People hate getting loads of ice but if we don't have a lot of ice we add more mixer so it looks full, unless the customer wants it to look half empty. Its better to get alot of ice, or even better then that, just a glass.  I'm in love with her so of course. On the weekday you can expect about 10. A weekend day can double that figure. We sell mostly spirits though because of the low price between a single and a double. We go through nearly 8 bottles of just plain Smirnoff vodka a day on the weekend.  hmm funny? this guy got ridiculously drunk they we couldn't serve him anymore. He wasn't aggressive just kept falling into people. He did want food though and he ordered about 3 starters, 3 mains and 3 dessert all for himself all to arrive at the same time. He was being asked if he was sure he wanted to buy all this for himself, and we were telling him his friends had gone home etc. but he was insistent so he bought it. And fair play to him he ate all of it.  No idea how but he did. The he got up, slightly more sober and went home. Hat tip to that man.  I know man same here. People come to wetherspoons for a cheap drink and we always must try and upsell. Very annoying for both customer and employee 2 kinds of people: 1) people threatening you with weapons whilst shouting or trying to spit on you, that's annoying. Or really quiet people, mainly people having a discussion about transformers or something, not leaving after we close and demanding they stay and finish their drink in glasses not cups on the street.  Even though no one has told me directly, yes I believe this is the case, but ofc we're talking about weeks before not days before. And this is true for draught beers such as lagers etc. Ales, spirits, bottles are all bought normally  $1,000,000 ;) Haha, pretty damn accurate. Well I hope so anyway! something around 1500 for a large breakfast so I would doubt they would lie about something that high on unless it was ture Im not sure how long it takes the ale to go off, we have it in a cool (not cold) cellar and it runs out every time so we have never had to change a barrel due to it being off.

I was asked to make a double gin and tonic and got a small bollocking because i didn't offer the client a more expensive gin. I am doing this part time whilst I study at uni.  Never been to the states but the cheap beer we sell is only possible for two reasons. Firstly, we get beer that is nearing its end date, and secondly, companies cut deals with the owners because if the sheer number of pubs in the company. I work on the bar but not one that I know of.

He lived in a different neighborhood than mine across a busy street. I was on my way out the door when his big brother gave us a DOUBLE-DARE I will never forget. I was about 8 years old at the time, so i didnt know any better. The Dare: eat a whole packet of cool-aid without spitting any out. I took cherry, my friend took grape. \n","\n","I thought to myself well i love the drink so this cant be that bad. Little did i know cool-aid without water and sugar is insanely bad for you. We ripped the tops off of the packets at the same time. From experience eating hot foods (previous dares) i tried to get as much saliva swooshed around in my mouth as possible. My friend got his packet half way into his mouth before he accidently inhaled, and started coughing up purple dust. I saw this and tried not to breath through my mouth. That's when it hit my, the most tart/biter thing i have ever put into my mouth. Luckily i had a lot of saliva and was able to swallow the majority of the packet. \n","\n","I was victorious, I was the cooler person, I was a god. It was time for me to ride my bike back home, I was as happy as could be. This was about a 10min ride. About 4mins after getting onto my bike i get mad sweaty and my mouth starts watering. I know then i have made a bad decision. I am also right next to the super busy rode between our neighborhoods. I realize somethings wrong, and start getting massive stomach cramps. I then start to poltergeist vomit while riding my bike down the road. This isnt just normal vomit, its dark chunky blood red. Cars start pulling over, i just keep riding home, vomiting all over my handle bars, chest, and front tire. This happens all the way home about 6 blocks. I get home crying covered in red vomit. My mom is doing yardwork, and sees me from about a block away. She starts running to me. I dont have time to explain what happens before i start vomiting again. After the last session of vomiting i explain what happened. I get grounded, and instructed to never play with my friend anymore at his house.\n","\n","At the time i was very scared/embarrassed that i did something so dumb. My bike was stained red for weeks. I had a bad time. That being said I  hope someone reads this and gets their friends to eat a whole packet of cool aid, while video taping it. Also note, i was only 8 years old, so if you plan to do this to a full size person, maybe double up. I assume no responsibility for your dares. Out of what i have played the Staff Ele has some incredible burst. Below is the build i use. As you can see it is very boon intensive. I stay in fire the majority of the time, unless i decide to run or heal.\n","\n","http://www.gw2builds.org/create/bwe_1/elementalist#0.0-2.4.1.16.3-30.10.0.10.20-7.11.12.8.1.2.5\n","\n","I try to optimize boon generation, and chain effects. On vet or higher mobs I start with Glyph of Elementals (pet fire or earth depending on dmg/tank) and Glyph of elemental harmony ( for the might stack) then Lava Font, Arcane Wave for the bonus might. I then use burning retreat followed by meteor shower, instantly followed by arcane blast. Make sure you use arcane blast with burning retreat for the extra fire damage (they synergize). Also note that you can still cast while casting meteor shower. Sometimes i cast meteor shower right before roll back and it doesn't brake the casting. Then i will cast glyph of storms and flame burst. \n","\n","Once the first cast through is done I Cycle back through. This time starting with burning retreat (facing opposite of the mob) into the mob. Lava Font + Arcane Wave, Meteor Shower, Glyph of storms, flame burst, burning retreat, and then finally arcane blast. Cast Glyph of Elemental Harmony whenever possible for extra might\n","\n","For most vet's/tanky mobs and above i will get right around 48 stacks of might midway through the fight, and sustain that until down. Notice that I have set up my attributes to 30/10/10/20. This optimise's casting speed for fire skills, arcane finishers (Arcane wave/Arcane Blast), and Glyphs, along with Might generation. Due to the fast casting times, i occasionally switch out my Glyph of elemental Harmony for Signet of Restoration, for the heal on cast, which gives you that bit extra healing while in fire so you dont have to swap to water. This build is also solo, if im with a zerg damage doesn't really matter...\n","\n","For the majority of the spells they are direct damage AOE/over positional direct damage. They also cause burning, and usually have over-time damage associated with them (burning retreat). The Burst damage not considering all of the nice extras you get is very nice. I can 2 shot most non tank/vet mobs in orr just using my arcanes, and due to traits they have a super low cooldown. However this is not a very practical build for anything but pve, since the majority of it is very positional. \n","8295 another thing i have wondered about... every time a creature closes with strippin should he get an attack of opportunity? as they are moving through a space he is threatening.  london, england... plus i am a tour guide... spare room with a double bed depending on the dates... 2 big dogs my work scehdule is slightly messed up but... i am in the uk so generally anytime 8pm-1am is ok for me gmt i would be interested as a player... i have a good bit of rollplaying exprience. i have a working webcam and skype... well no time is set in stone but roughly thinking 8pm-11pm so for you 10am-1pm I am Uk time so +00 and i have all of the pdfs, d&d experience is not required just skype and roll20  \n","8296 Also, for those who are curious, I am wanting to be a woman. \n","8297 Recovering drug addicts do it every day.

If you want precise info, get yourself a Q&A session with a lawyer in your particular State. Your freedom might depend on a formality. Whatever you say, pal. I understand where you're coming from, but seriously dude, personal feelings aside, acting like this will land you in prison. US courts have (almost) unanimously reflected that shooting/stabbing a man because he swung and/or landed a punch at you puts you on the wrong side of the law. They will almost universally see you as the person who escalated it to a lethal confrontation. Disparity of Force situations, and very specific attacks (like bashing someone's head into the ground, for instance) are where we find it legal to shoot unarmed assailants, but an able-bodied male against another able-bodied male playing fisticuffs will almost certainly not be seen in that light in a court of law.\n","\n","Regardless of personal feelings on the matter and the realities of violent encounters, this is how our courts have viewed self-defense situations for decades. I'd rather be on trial than dead if there is absolutely no escape from the violence, no doubt, but I also prefer my freedom over my pride and possessions.\n","\n","Thinking about things like this allows you to incorporate precautions as you go about your business to increase the likelihood of having the best outcome possible should shit hit the proverbial fan. \n","\n","I highly recommend Massad Ayoob's lectures and advice on the subject for a professional explanation. It is indeed Detective 101.

You thought right, honestly. I can hear his snarky cadence now... Yeah, Cthulhu tends to win. Dagon would make a great short film, as would The Statement of Randolph Carter and The Music of Erich Zann. My top choice for a feature-length would probably be The Temple, though, considering the necessary visual aspect of the story isn't particularly indescribable like you'd find in Dreams In The Witch House, The Colour Out of Space, or The Call of Cthulhu (ones you see most people suggesting), but it still gets across all the main points of the \"Lovecraft vibe\".\n","\n","I find most of his well-known stories would make terrible movies if we retained the original formats, but his more obscure work is a bit more down-to-earth (relatively speaking....) and translates across mediums better. Everyone keeps saying this, but I don't know if I agree.\n","\n"," Sure, the \"horror at the camp\", the flight over the mountain range to reveal the city, and the eventual exit from said city, would all work well on film. But how would we explain the history and culture of the Elder Things/Old Ones? They're presented to the reader through a biologist's collective interpretation of a series of scattered pieces of art and sculptures, and IMO this is the meat-and-potatoes of the story. \n","\n","I just can't imagine a scenario in which the same info can be effectively presented to a movie audience.  Caregivers who use them to get in the front of the line at amusement parks? I'm not saying it's not disgusting and patronizing, I'm just saying it's not a big deal.

While feeling betrayed by Hydaelyn for having lied to us all this time, and for having caused the current system to even exist. Hey, Emet-Selch's plans are usually pretty good! It's just when he delegates that things go to hell (for everyone). But true, the Ascians don't come across as the most competent group somehow, despite having successfully accomplished a bunch of rejoinings (and one ruined one, but still). It's almost endearing.\n","\n","They really did a fantastic job with Emet-Selch, and I'm entirely aware you're not *supposed* to reach the tipping point of \"Ascians should win\" rather than \"Ascians are sympathetic, but ultimately need to fail.\" I'm not going to argue that they're right, because they aren't, but their absolute tragedy of a world and a situation just- ah. It hits too hard. I really really love tragic narratives. ...Yes, actually. \n","\n","I don't have any moral argument or justification, but in just that small time that we got to experience Amaurot, I became more attached to it than anywhere else in the game. I didn't want to :c\n","\n","Honestly it did make me wish this was the sort of game with different story paths, I totally would've sided with Emet-Selch. yeah nevermind the Restoration of Ishgard\n","\n","Restoration of Amaurot when???\n","\n","goddamn i want to rebuilt it and also live there I think it's sometimes understated that while Emet-Selch was obviously the vector through which Vauthry was created, he didn't *force* Vauthry's father to accept that bargain. That father was the real villain in that scene, I felt- he was willing to sacrifice his own son to attain power, for both himself and his lineage. Willing, even eager to accept the idea of controlling sin eaters, rather than fighting them. His poor wife never even got a say, it seems like. \n","\n","This actually seems to be a minor theme with Emet-Selch, and part of why he feels justified with his continued disgust/dismissiveness towards the sundered races. Ascians provide the tools, the information- but it's the mortals who choose to actually perform the atrocities. It's more clear in this case than most, even, since Vauthry's father was clearly more concerned with preserving his own skin, rather than tragically sacrificing his son for some perceived good for the world. It was absolutely a selfish action, and just further reinforces Emet-Selch's worldview.\n","\n","Not that I'm saying Emet-Selch is completely blameless, or that Vauthy isn't deserving of sympathy in his own way, but the absolute villain in that scene is totally Vauthry's father. Yeah, I really love current SMN. It's my favorite version of the class, easily. Sure, there's some small things that could be tweaked, and I wouldn't turn down some potency increases, but the actual core of the class feels really good to me. \n","\n","I'm a little disheartened that a number of people seem to dislike it so much. Sabik is also the name of one of the stars in the Ophiuchus/Serpentarius constellation, which is traditionally associated with Zodiark, which I always thought was a nice touch.\n","\n","I hope we finally find out what it is eventually. I wonder if we'll ever see anything named after the other stars (None of them have turned up in Astrologian weapons, anyway, which I assume is deliberate.). \n","\n","I admit I'm a little biased since I named my character after one of the other stars, so I hope it'll show up in some form someday. I know a bit of that feeling from healing (Benediction why are you healing me oh *no* not again; also Rescuing someone's corpse halfway across the map), it does feel pretty bad, haha. Sometimes your timing's just off, and I can definitely see why people would rather rely on defensive buffs they know are going to be around to mitigate big hits, rather than risk timing the invuln abilities wrong. Still, it's pretty satisfying to see WARs putting out more damage than half the DPS while still staying comfortably alive. Oh definitely, it's no fun (if sort of funny) getting stuck in place when your opponent can just swim off the island and leave you waving an axe by your lonesome. \n","\n","And that's a shame about that boss- I mean, they know you're going to be using WAR in the WAR questline, having interactions to account for you using your whole toolkit would've been a cool bonus. I live in Norway, where it's permanently light this time of year, so I feel like I'm inherently prepared to face a world of perpetual day.\n","\n","Just have to try to sleep for a few hours before the sun comes the rest of the way back up and the game is out.... Yeah, if they leave it the same, it's going to look a bit odd now. Ah, that makes sense. I don't really tank so I don't know what's preferable, but it does feel like tanks don't use their invulnerability buttons enough. It's fantastic mitigation! But I see that the shorter cooldown than Hallowed + less tricky than Living Dead would make it pretty powerful for the people who know how to use it.\n","\n","God I love Living Dead, even if it takes a little more planning to use outside of emergencies, it's just really cool. Yeah, it always felt the most awkward to use, even if I appreciated the name. It'd be funny if you could anchor bosses in place regardless of mechanics, but yeah... not really a feasible mechanic.\n","\n","It'd be cool if they left it in for PVP, since moves can be a bit different there anyway. Ah, that's true! The gimmick is interesting flavor, but utility should win out in the end. ...Yes? I'm not talking about the utility at all, it can be a mess to use.\n","\n","But the name! Made sense! It's a pity they removed the self-bind to it. Now the name doesn't work at all!\n","\n","(It was an old Norse tradition of settling conflicts by leaving the two combatants on a small, empty island. Only one left. So the movement restriction made sense!) Seriously, I might actually transmute things now! I really like the tree :c\n","\n","I'd love there to be more dead/broken items available. rip in peace little turret\n","\n","You will be missed :c Really curious as to how the SMN changes will shake out. With Titan/Topaz no longer able to tank, I wonder if they'll actually have a place in regular dungeon/raid use. Those aren't the only two options in the world, y'know.\n","\n","I'm with the above that the recruitment sounds... really obnoxious, but hell, you do you. I mean, why *not* try to get a group of people together who have the same kind of humor. I'm glad your group has worked out for you. Sometimes I wish we could keep some of the class names instead of the job ones. I mean.... Black Mage is iconic but Thaumaturge just sounds cool to me. Same with Conjurer and Arcanist for that matter. And Gladiators and Marauders... I really like the class names.\n","\n","I'm not saying they *should* be kept or anything, but still, I really like them. It depends partially on what role you're in. DPS'll get replaced instantly, but if you're the tank? GJ on screwing over everyone else who has to wait for your replacement (if it ever comes). Don't pretend you're a passive entity who's actions only impact yourself.\n","\n","Yeah you don't owe anyone anything. It does make you an asshole, though.

Not a single person whining in this thread even read the damn article. Oh...my.

It's one I've been wanting to read for years, but haven't, for no good reason really. That book sounds fascinating, thanks! Oh man. What a goof. I love it when people on this sub just say totally subjective things as if they're kindly educating an idiot about a fundamental law of physics. Violent felons escape situations and are arrested later all the damn time. Police chases like you see in video games and movies are dangerous and reckless and that's why they almost never happen in real life. \n","\n","Really, If you replace cop with suspect then it reads that you're advocating a cop use as much force as necessary to apprehend a suspect as quickly as possible. You'd fit right in with the bootlicking, blue lives matter crowd. \n","\n","I get the feeling that nothing short of blowing this cop's - sorry, suspect's brains out in the street on the spot would satisfy you. If you claim to broadly be against police brutality then you're creating a double standard for people you don't like. \n","\n",">You keep saying number one priority is deescalation but unless you’re an idiot, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that’s not the number one priority. \n","\n","There's plenty of evidence that ACAB and are racist and shitty at their job, but that doesn't change what their priority ought to be. \n","\n","There are standards that should be in place for police conduct and procedure, and I bet we agree on almost all of those. I'm just saying you don't get to create an exception for that because the suspect is a cop, as much as one might like to. No ones talking about not intervening. The commenter above was saying they would trick the officer into letting them take the person to the station. That's stopping a kidnapping. I think any sensible person would advocate for taking further steps if the officer refused to let you take them to the station. A police officers job is to keep everyone safe, not make sure they arrest the bad guy as fast as possible. That standard doesn't change just because the bad guy is another cop.\n","\n","Just because lethal force is used wrongly all the time in other situations doesn't mean this cop should use force in this hypothetical situation. If playing a trick on another officer is the best way to resolve the situation safely and protect those involved then so be it.

So I am not saying all this in anger or in any way snarky I just wanted to point out that for some of us gamers we use these cracks as a tool,  I aint saying everyone should do it, its my own little thing I do but when I pay for a game I should have the option to play it even if my ROM burns out a week from payday and I have no other means of playing the game. I hope you understand where I'm coming from I just would like people to acknowledge not all crackers and copiers are evil thieves of intellectual property but some are just using a tool for a benefit that suits us. Hope that didnt come off to high and mighty and just for others that may have a go, I did say GAMES I ALREADY OWN I like to crack for more smoothness and preserving the disc that is essential to play (normally) and install with. but its not retard whats single player mode online for anyway? multiplayer idiot!  not a loser like you apparently thank you, a rationale fan. only reason I have gone off on here is coz of no one understanding that simple fact as you said 'Not everybody wants to play online', simple. it may be small but its still a percentage of the community, finally proof of sanity in an opinion. thank you, you just made my day. NO your not the only one! your like every other twit saying that. 'hello no.51' after you there will be another and another coz your brains are too small to think read other posts and see if 50 other people have already said the same shit FFS! get an original idea mate...... yeah mines a 2008 and now I think this wont last me 5 years it will last me 10 since all I will play is non-internet games and older titles, quality is gone its all bout quantity, such a shame, watching the gaming industry is a bit like watching a best friend get hooked on drugs and becomes a junkie, you watch helpless as they rob you and whore themselves out to anyone for their drug of choice (money) sad day for PC gamers everywhere. true the arguement for pirating is a bit double edged mainly coz it causes blizzard to look at the numbers and go oh shit the games getting pirated like crazy oh well more and tougher measures, cycle of piracy and anti piracy. then why do you waste energy reading and then posting up this? go play your online game, also theres a big difference between these sites and online gaming hell I can unplug my 115kb\\s mobile phone modem and walk away then plug it back in a still got this page up can just keep going can you do that with a game huh? moron think before you type and learn something bout PC's and how they work. theres a trick its in the menu to start in offline mode, works every boot up always offline and playable games without any connection what so ever. progression is long, that and by bout the 3rd act in nightmare requires you to be at least 60 to survive or at least D2 expansion did. (freaking tough) no way steam doesnt even have their logo or 'requires steam' on the front of the DOW2 box its down in the copyright stuff in tiny writing on the back. So why would Blizzard be any different? enjoy your buying levels and ego wanker learn how to play a REAL game mate its called being challanged not having shit handed to you, fucking loser. read some fucking posts idiot some of us dont have super duper internet like you and your mates what are you like 13 and mummy and daddy pay for your connection? piss off and go play with yourself looking at the blizzard and activision logos fan boy. Your right I know a few people who hate steam and got pirated dawn of war/2 versions before the release FFS, since they only wanted the single player mode and didnt see why they had to spend over 12 hours downloading a game they just bought. So its not bout piracy its about control, that and the fact that why not release two versions of the game, single player only and multiplayer only simple solution, problem solved. so why not market it as an mmo only why say single player (the implication being I can play on my own) huh? go SKIDROW!!! Oh yeah or maybe all 4 hey mate type steam sucks into google thats all I will say... amen to that, I prefer to play offline and at my own pace as well. its just to stop the 5 year olds from whinging that people keep taking their shit online and wont team up with them. I know I experience it on a lot of games kids that bitch coz your better at the game or coz they dont get their own way, try a team CTF on Halo 3 or reach, the amount of kids that just quit when they dont get a map or weapon they want is a joke. OMFG what the hell? is this a joke? I had a thought if they want people to play it online fine get rid of single player and sell it just like WOW, but of course cant do that coz they wont sell as many copies unless they dupe innocent buyers into thinking they can play it solo, great now we got Blizzactivisionard and steam bullshit whats next you got to give them your home address number and allow cameras in your house and spyware on your pc so they can make sure your not cheating, FKN big brother welcome soon we wont be able to take a piss without signing up to something and having to have an internet connection FFS I love Diablo 1 and 2 now with this knowledge I just pray some very smart dudes out there do like with dawn of war 2 the supposedly unpirateable game (YEAH RIGHT!) seriously and whats this shit bout an online store to buy shit WTF? so some 6yo can get on and basically buy his way up the levels when the point is earning your rewards and level ups.

If one option leads to 500,000 people being killed and one leads to a million, I'll vote for the former. Is voting an action? Would you say that almost all democrats voting for withdrawal from Iraq and almost all republicans voting against it shows a bit of difference between the parties? What good has that done? You take a long, hard look at yourself and realize that you have to make concessions to help the world. Vote for the mainstream party you think will go to war the least, not some fringe party that will never be elected.

The war in Iraq was very unpopular. Honestly, I think he would have followed through and we would have waaaay more troops oversees than with Obama.  I don't understand why they vote differently if they're exactly the same. Why would John McCain say he didn't want to take the troops out of Iraq if he was just going to do the same thing as Obama?

Good discussion! Never said \"new departure\"...Just another \"event\"\n","\n","Excited for whatever way it finishes! A lot of people are going to be wrong about their theories (including me), and I'm fine with that. But having the discussion is part of the draw to the show. Not happy that we only have 6 episodes remaining. Happy watching, JJay!\n","\n","\n"," We all agree that the ORIGINAL departure happened on the 14th in US, and the 15th in Australia because of time difference. My thought was on a new event that also takes place on the upcoming 14th, or 15th in Australia that Kevin Sr. seems to be talking about.\n","\n","I haven't been able to watch it again, but did he say \"seven year anniversary of the departure\", or \"seven year anniversary of the 15th\"?\n","\n","I'm probably wrong on all of this, but I love how this show makes us pay attention to every small detail. Australians are weird. Haha \n","\n","I agree with your thought, but I don't think this show has followed logical order to this point. I'm with ya, I get the time difference thing, but I'm saying that the weatherman and the 4 ladies are referencing a new event that we haven't seen yet (making the last scene happen in the future, 7 years later to be exact) Love this show.\n","\n","Just a thought. The last scene could still be in future. The Harveys (Kevin or Kevin Sr.) could be trying to \"stop the Apocalypse\" in the present and something crazy happens on the 14th (15th in Australia). The weatherman saying 7th anniversary of the 15th could be referencing this new event and not the original 14th. Would explain the 4 ladies quoting from Book of Kevin as well as weatherman's biblical joking.\n","\n","Know it's a stretch, but with this show, it's possible.

The new propellant system we use is called MACS (Modular Artillery Charge System)  There are two sizes, Lima and Hotel.  Charges 1 and 2 would use Lima charges.  Charges 3-5 would use hotel charges.  The US Marine Corps still occasionally uses old propellant which is a bag charge, or one size only.  We adopted the new system to cut down on the waste.\n","\n","Older Howitzers such as the U.S. Army's 105mm still uses a propellant that has 7 separate charges.  You only use what you need, and you have to burn the rest.  I agree it is a waste. Another reason that many of the artillery strikes in Afghanistan are hitting within a meter or two is because the use of Excalibur rounds is commonly used in order to decrease collateral damage.  Excalibur rounds are GPS guided and are very accurate. For manual aiming you would use a chart where you mark deflection of the gun as well as the azimuth of the observer, who is calling the fire mission. You then use a specialized protractor to determine range and deflection. You plug those numbers into a book of data to determine information on where to aim. You also have to account for weather, changes in elevation, weight of the specific round you are firing and other things. \n","There are also digital systems that take a lot of the manual work out of this but artillery men need to know how to compute manually incase the digital system isn't working. \n","Source: I am in the US Marine Corps  Yes it is. On the m777, the newer charges are used in increments. Depending on the range it could be charge 1 through charge 5. Each charge is basically propellant wrapped in a container that can be loaded separately. For example charge 2 would use 2 blocks of the propellant.  They are waterproof too? What can't they do?

It's a really interesting question, I think!\n","\n","PS. Would you mind putting your comment on the blog itself? I think that it would be useful for people who want to delve a bit deeper!  Think about lines through the origin as linear subspaces of RxR. These contain the reals, as we can send r to {(x, rx)|x∈R}, injectively. The additional line to which no real is sent to is the y axis, which we can call ∞. \n","\n","Now, thinking about these subspaces as relations, relational composition corresponds to multiplication. Then inverse is the reverse relation. Now you can take the inverse of 0 (the x-axis), obtaining ∞. Then 0/0 is interesting, because either it is the unique 0 dimensional subspace or the unique 2-dimensional subspace, depending on the order you compose (i.e. does 0/0 mean 0 × 1/0 = 0 × ∞ or 1/0 × 0 = ∞ × 0  ? – the point is that multiplication is no longer commutative when ∞ is involved.)\n","\n","Taking this idea seriously, you get a system of reals with ∞ and two extra elements, which are the two meanings for 0/0. It's a reasonable extension of projective arithmetic.\n","\n","You can find the details [here](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/12/14/26-keep-calm-and-divide-by-zero/) but the graphical syntax might take a while to get the hang of.  yeah, sorry about that; the episode was already too long. Yep, the plan is to discuss signal flow graphs next.\n","\n","Symplectic stuff sounds like an interesting direction: when you have something written down, send me a link!

No, check out the [multiplication table](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/12/14/26-keep-calm-and-divide-by-zero/). Thanks :) Glad to be back! Yves Lafont, the guy behind interaction nets, has also worked on a graphical language which is closely related to a sub theory of graphical linear algebra, see this [paper](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~lafont/pub/circuits.pdf). Lafont's work was definitely an inspiration for us. It's difficult to do a good job explaining in a short comment, but if you're interested you can check out these papers [1](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ps/papers/rp2014.pdf),[2](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ps/papers/popl15.pdf),[3](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05076). The first is about Petri nets, the next two are about signal flow graphs. I definitely plan to discuss these on the blog. It's not really meant as a reorganisation of algebra, more as an exploration of some algebraic structures that appear in many applications (e.g. bimonoids, Frobenius monoids) but are 1) not as well known and as appreciated as I think they should be, and 2) sometimes hidden when the applications are presented in the usual way. \n","\n","My current plans are to eventually to cover the topics of standard undergrad linear algebra, and also discuss some applications in control theory and concurrency theory that I've been working on for the last few years. Also maybe a bit about quantum computing and quantum information, where similar structures have been used for some time; there are a couple of textbooks coming out shortly about this. So I guess one way to look at it would be to go along the lines that you are suggesting: turn it into a question of universal algebra. The objects of study are sets equipped with operations. Something like this:\n","\n","http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/32092/how-are-vector-spaces-viewed-as-universal-algebras\n","\n","Then can one ask what are the substructures, prove isomorphisms theorems, etc. It's one way of going about things, but several things are not entirely satisfactory. For example, in the case of the vector space, we'd have infinitely many operations because one would need a scalar multiplication for each element of the field. \n","\n","But still, there are things about vector subspaces that are special, that have a uniquely linear algebraic flavour. For example, every subspace of a finite dimensional vector space is the solution set of a finite set of homogenous equations. Every subspace can be given some finite basis and then its elements can be expressed as linear combinations of the basis vectors. Universal algebra doesn't see these facts... they become theorems that one proves after you've set up all your definitions. The definitions themselves are expressed in a language (set, operation, field action) that's powerful—in the sense it let's you set up a lot of interesting mathematical structures in a reasonably uniform way—but the language itself is quite low level and not particularly robust.\n","\n","Maybe I should explain a bit what I mean by \"robustness\". Let's define a spork-space to be like a vector space, but with two additional group actions GxV->V and HxV->V satisfying \\forall g\\in G \\forall v\\in V \\exists h\\in H g.v = h.v. I have no idea what this condition means, I just made it up on the spot. Should we employ a couple of PhD students to study these structures? Of course not. We wrote down some arbitrary condition and there's no reason why this structure should have any relevance. But we are used to having definitions presented to us in this way.\n","\n","So I have some reservations about the usual way of defining a vector space as a set with extra structure. Another point is that linear algebra shows up in applications (e.g. in graph theory) where it's not so easy to state precisely what are the vectors, the linear transformations etc. Is it a total fluke?\n","\n","I'll give you a spoiler: in the last diagrammatic system, the one from this episode (no. 24) the diagrams from m to n are in 1-1 correspondence with subspaces of Q^m x Q^n. And no definition of vector space in sight! \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"," I see your point. But my argument is not only about matrices, although it's true that I haven't spoken of much else in the 24 episodes so far. Actually that's about to change in the next episode.\n","\n","Let me try to illustrate my point. What's your working definition of vector subspace? A subset of the elements of a vector space closed under a commutative, associative addition operation and scalar multiplication? Where did this definition come from? \n"," Hey, no need to justify your criticism, it's very useful.\n","\n","I guess I did not intend to give a severe beating to \"traditional mathematics\", but I can see that it can be read that way. I also use \"traditional mathematics\" sometimes! \n","\n","Your comments deserve a much longer reply, and I will write one on the blog eventually.\n","\n","For now, let me distill my beliefs into some kind of core: a lot of \"traditional mathematics\", especially in core subjects like linear algebra, is like an archeological site. Many techniques, notations, etc. were developed to ease calculation by hand, and today we have machines to do these things for us. For some of these techniques and notations, to use computing terminology, one could maybe use the word \"hacks\", in the sense that they were developed primarily to ease calculation. So I don't mean \"hacks\" in a negative sense: fast calculation is clearly a huge advantage. But, then again, it's 2015 and no human can beat even a modern microwave for pure computational speed. \n","\n","I think that matrices are such a hack, an extremely useful hack, but a hack nonetheless. Does anyone, anywhere in the world really multiply matrices by hand, away from the artificial setting of Algebra 101? Or find the eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix? Why do we teach these algorithms? Because we are convinced that by memorising them the student will obtain a deeper insight into the underlying subject? I think that the opposite is true: by focussing on hacks, we are obscuring the underlying mathematics.\n","\n","This is because, as any programmer will tell you, hacks are useful and tempting, but in the long run they come back to bite you. And I think that can sometimes happen in maths as well: once you've seen a hack a 1000 times, it becomes second nature, it feels natural. Even if it obscures the underlying structure, the \"real mathematical content\" underneath. So—to use programming jargon again—instead of developing our maths with a low level language of hacks it makes sense to spend some time developing more high-level languages that don't hide the underlying structure. Languages that are more robust, and that help the user to understand what's going on under the surface. I think that the language that I'm writing about on the blog is an example of this, and I have several examples that I will write about in the near future that I think demonstrate this \"robustness\".  Thanks!\n","\n","And I totally agree with your interpretation of the apple incident. Nice spot! I didn't notice this before.\n","\n","I will put it on the blog; can I credit you in some way? PM me; otherwise I will just say /u/qazxcvqw from reddit :) Good question!\n","\n","I will stick with these generators for a while. As far as the complex numbers go,  I'm quite partial to the matrix representation, which works quite nicely from the graphical point of view.\n","\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Matrix_representation_of_complex_numbers Thanks! There's something really seductive about visual representations.\n","\n","One of my other research interests is Petri nets. One of my colleagues once told me an anecdote about what he observed one time when he was visiting a software business for which he was doing some consulting... so apparently one of the engineers was explaining some piece of software by drawing all kinds of Petri-net like objects on the board... and it turned out that no one in the room really had a very clear idea about the formal semantics of these things, but somehow the mere act of drawing and having a visual representation, even if not formal, was very helpful in their design process. It's cool, you're welcome to your opinions... I was just pointing out that they are fairly black and white.\n","\n","Maybe we can come back to your questions in a few months after I've had time to explain the theory a bit more, and go through some of the applications. \"No one cares about Geometric Algebra\" is a pretty absolute claim; do you have a citation for that? \n","\n","Googling, it seems that a lot of people do care about it quite a bit... Thanks for the questions.\n","\n","I would say the number one advantage apparent so far is that I've shown how to obtain the algebra of matrices of natural numbers using an extremely simple language of diagrams: four generators and ten equations (six, if you consider the meta-rule that every equation has a reflected, photographic-negative counterpart).\n","\n","To do the algebra of matrices of natural numbers using the standard approach you need:\n","\n","- to understand what the natural numbers are and prove that they form a semiring\n","\n","- give a definition of a matrix\n","\n","- give a definition of multiplication and direct sum\n","\n","That's a lot of work behind the scenes. Now to answer your questions:\n","\n","**What advantage does this have over standard linear algebra?** - I think that it simplifies proofs, it makes some symmetries/dualities apparent that are far from obvious using the traditional language and it fits better with several applications of linear algebra.\n","\n","**Does it prove anything we can't otherwise?** - so far, clearly not, because the language of diagrams I've introduced so is equivalent to matrices of natural numbers. Later, when we get to spaces, think the answer is yes, in the sense that things that look totally natural from the point of view of diagrams can be surprising in the \"traditional\" language. Given that the diagrammatic language carries much less definitional baggage, as I've argued above, sometimes this can yield very interesting insights.\n","\n","**drastically reduce the runtime of a typically long calculation?** - in applications, the answer is yes, because the diagrammatic language emphasises compositionality, meaning divide and conquer. Thanks a lot! Keep reading, the most interesting bits are still to come. :) Thanks, I appreciate it! I'm looking forward to discussing a bit more when I write about dynamical systems.

I'm writing this because for my fiance, when he tried the subs, all he got were the negative side effects & none of the relief.  Our doctor said that it's rare, but there are certain cases where the subs don't affect the users brain in the correct way, and technically he was having a mild allergic reaction to them.  We both decided on methadone maintenance and it worked for both of us, like a dream.  We've now been completely clean, off of everything, for over a year now... and it's amazing.  You can do it.  You just have to find which way is the \"right\" way for you personally.  I started my decade long addiction to all things opiate with methadone (methadone was my doc, but I'd take absolutely anything to stop the excruciating withdrawal).  I got clean, with the help of Suboxone, then got off the Suboxone, and I was completely sober.\n","\n","I have endometriosis (a condition that affects my reproductive system & is very painful), and my doctor wrote me a script for tramadol.  I thought (stupidly) that because they were so weak, I could take them and be fine, that the withdrawal wouldn't be bad at all, because I had already been through withdrawal from much stronger opiates.  My script was for 240 pills a month (8 pills per day), and I was taking double, sometimes even triple, my prescribed dosage.  Obviously I ran out way before my script was due to be refilled and, dear Lord, the withdrawal was about one million times worse than I could have imagined.  I was stupid, and prolonged my misery by buying some, taking them to end the withdrawal, running out, withdrawing, buying more, etc.  Eventually I kicked the habit (the tramadol habit anyway.... I fought with many more demons in the following years, culminating in a massive heroin addiction before finally finding, and sticking with, recovery), but the withdrawal from Tramadol was right up there with some of the worst withdrawal I've experienced on other drugs.\n","\n","It's nothing to joke about.  I wish you all the best.  You CAN do this.  This group is here for you, utilize it!  Good luck!! I never got into stimulants... heroin & benzodiazepines were my drugs of choice.  All I have to say is that I thought I was \"maintaining\", too, and I so wasn't.  Absolute recovery is so gratifying.  I work a 40+ hr week, I'm a full-time student (school during the day, work at night), I'm engaged to a wonderful man, and we have a three year old son.  I still find time to do not only group therapy, but twice monthly one-on-one therapy as well.  I seriously thought I had my addiction under control.  I mean, c'mon!  I wasn't like those pathetic junkies (yes I was)!  Self delusion is an addicts best friend.  In just the short amount of time that I've been clean (I was an active heroin addict for ten years, shooting it for seven years) I have accomplished so much!  I went from living on my mom's couch in a one bedroom apartment, with no car, having to beg, borrow & steal just to get the $6\n","for a pack of cigarettes to having my own place, my own car, getting my education so that I can have a career rather than \"just a job\" (and I realize you are in college at the moment, and I really do hope you can hold yourself together long enough to graduate, but it's so much easier when you remove that monkey from your back.. when you're burning the candle at both ends you're bound to get burnt) and I have enough of a \"cushion\" to be able to buy something on a whim and not worry about the ramifications of spending money.  And really, the entire time I was using I thought I was doing fine &that my quality of life wasn't suffering at all.  It's only now that I'm clean that I can look back and see that most days I was barely keeping my head above water, and other days I was completely submerged, drowning.. and doing so happily.  Getting clean is hard work, and you have to want it with every fiber of your being but, I promise you, it is SO.  FUCKING. WORTH. IT. Was there ever an update?

It gives you the time to move on, nobody gets hurt and you won't accidentally say something you don't want to in the long term. Rekindle the friendship when you've got closure.

The worst part is when those fundies make it look as if nobody in the children's country of origin cared about them and the fundies were the white saviours who swooped in.

They made some quantitative interviews with women who admitted that they regret having kids. It was very insightful. As a German, I totally agree with you.

I think it's balanced according to what the devs sees as overpowered. I prefer death to another source of knockdown... I played the game since hydroid launch and after a long pause, returned last year. The game history has been developed, the gameplay improved, but what makes the game special is its uniqueness, in all aspects. Design, art, lore, soundtrack and the relation the developers have with the players. I would prefer that the passives suited the classes better. It could also have different atributes among classes for other races/genders like max health for krogan vanguard and max shield for human; or biotic damage for female human adept vs recharge speed for male, increasing build diversity and making characters more unique.

Perdition's Blade is a good tempo card against minions like shielded minibot,  annoy-o-trion or decks with a lot of low health ones, aggro for instance. It trades with a 3 or 4 health minion, depending on the combo, which is very common in the present meta. On paper, it's worth a try.  For me, winning is not what makes the games fun. Players which grind the ladder for ranks get their reward when they see that low number representing their \"skill\", the process is not fun, but they aim for the prize of a high rank achievement. Because I play video games for fun, I do not care about this bullshit and enjoy each game expecting nothing in return, just the joy of a complete shenanigan play.\n","\n","www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u-dxn8IgQo A change i would like for the **kidnapper** would be: make him 6/2 and give him stealth. This would increase his play even without combo and fits well with the the overall theme of the card, i.e. the dude kidnappes someone and then vanish into the shadows. Besides, increasing his chances of staying on the board would make it  possible to trade with a bigger minion, around the 5-7 mana group making the mid game of rogue stronger.\n"," \n","8359 That is an amazing way to put it.

Time to rethink how to organise them...  As far as I remember the oldest evidence are the Qumram Scrolls or Dead Sea Scrolls.  Milka is definitively not the best example; originally from Suchard (in Neuchâtel?) - but most of today's Milka Schokolade is produced in Lörrach Germany - right next to the French and Swiss Border. I admire Lindt Chocolate. Bar or Pralines. Doesn't matter!  Milo Moiré - a Swiss performance artist, as she considers herself. Doing art usually naked and in public - like dropping color balls/eggs out of her vagina on a canvas or walking bare-naked in public, written clothing pieces in words on her body or shooting pictures naked with tourists in front of the Eiffel tower. I'm actually very open-minded, when it comes to art. But in my opinion she's often just trying to get media's attention. I find it quite boring. You might already have a computer. So get your first DAW / Audio processing programs for free. There are some really good open source projects out there for quite any operating system (for example Ardour, renoise, Mixxx - you name it). And get yourself the trial version of all the popular products like ableton live or bitwig studio. Try it. Read about it, check their youtubes. \n","\n","A pair of speakers or a hi-fi system might be your own already too. So I'd highly suggest you first look for a better audio interface. Because the audio chipset of your computer can be outplayed with even a low-priced USB interface. I for myself bought me once a quite cheap focusrite interface (the saffire 6USB in specific) and used it for years before I invested in a better one. It gives you not only a better audio quality, more of you have multiple in and outputs which will come in handy, the more you start building your personal \"battle-station\" at home, playing and recording. \n","\n","With this early investment in the USB audio interface your demand will grow: Maybe you want to sing?

At least in Vanilla.\n","\n","In Vanilla, plants can only spawn in the borders of the map, then spread from there.\n","\n","That's why some biomes, like temperate forests, only see green fields in the first year.

If those are the ones you get with the mod Seeds Please when you harvest grass, then they aren't exactly grass seeds, but hay seeds. If you plant them, you'll only get hay, which is not green and will not spread. That's why I think you'll need Lush Meadow for your project, supposing it's possible at all. Thanks for the help!

This doesn't sound like a bug, it sounds like your prisoners never made their way to their cells.\n","\n","I'm guessing something happened to them in the way. They may have been hunted by wild animals. They may have gotten too hungry/tired and suffered mental breaks, then wandered around and died/got killed, etc.\n","\n","I suggest looking for corpses in the vicinity of your base. Ok, it's been a few days since we had this conversation, but I thought about something you could try.\n","\n","Since you don't really have new mods to ty out, you could make your next playthrough unique in four different ways.\n","\n","1) Playing with the scenario settings to modify the pawns. Establishing a 50% or even a 100% chance for pawns to spawn with a specific trait or something like that.\n","\n","2) Playing with the scenario settings to modify the world. Generating a world with a permanent volcanic winter or a permanent toxic fallout. Activating the climate cycle game condition or even download the Climate Cycle++ mod to make the climate cycle more extreme.\n","\n","3) Do a world circumvention run. Spawning a 100% sized world and having your pawns live a nomadic lifestyle, walking all the way around the world. The goal is to eventually return to the first landing point.\n","\n","4) Roleplaying. Yes, the playthroughs you've shared with us already include a lot of RP, you can always try something more complex or specific.\n","\n","For example, when I still used to play vanilla-ish, a few years ago,, before luciferium or mech serums, I used EdB to create a family of five or six, can't remember.  One of those pawns, however, was a bad-backed, frail and blind 70-yo woman who was the family's grandma. They landed in ice sheet, so the old lady was more of a burden than of an asset, and the point of the RP was to keep the grandma and at least one other family member alive and launch them to space. I failed several times, and only managed to succeed when I toned the difficulty down to rough.\n","\n","There are other possibilities for RP. For example, you can start with all colonists being of a single gender, and having your faction only recruit/buy/rescue pawns of that same gender, then create a story on why they act like this. You can also have a vegetarian colony (no meat, leather or butchering) or even a vegan one (same as the former one, but also no wool or milk).\n","\n","As far as I can tell, these are all very different from the colonies you're used to playing, so you may not really like the ideas. On the other hand, they might interest you exactly because they are different from your different playthroughs. Mental Break: Verbal Abuse\n","\n","Last Straw: Couldn't read the whole story. Yes, it did. A long time ago, to be fair. It's like \"Don't poke around in the study... lest you want to spend the rest of your days in there.\" Indeed. Actually, I looked at the pictures and somehow simply assumed he had already used that mod. I feel this speaks a bit about how much it would fit the aesthetics of his base. Yes, I'd like to hear about the little story you made up for them. I love how people roleplay Rimworld. The hare of anguish. People already answered your question, so I'll give you a piece of advice. You may already know about this, but you're new to the game so it's possible you don't know yet.\n","\n","Think once or twice before you implant a joywire in someone. It comes with a permanent +30 mood bonus, but also with a -20% consciousness malus. Decreases in consciousness will decrease the pawn's performance/speed in every task by an equal ammount, so a pawn with a -20% consciousness penalty has a 80% consciousness, which makes it 80% as effective/fast in everything else. It's better to keep such pawns away from combat (as they'll have a hard time hitting the target/are easy targets, especially in melee) and from performing surgeries (low consciousness increase surgery failure chance).\n","\n","So, you'll want to save those joywires for those pawns who, for some reason or the other, suffer of chronic terrible mood, which usually don't happen unless you're playing the highest difficulties.\n","\n","Pawns with less than 30% consciousness will go unconscious and not wake up until their consciousness increases above that threshold. That's what happened to your pawn. It's possible that she would have not gone into vegetative state if it wasn't for the joywire.\n","\n","My advice is to hook her on Luciferium, but beware, since once you administer it to her, she'll need a dose every six days or so. If she doesn't get another dose in time, she'll start having random mental breaks. 10 days without luciferium means death.\n","\n","Alternatively, if you're attached to her, keep her as she is until you have a good ammount of luciferium/a healer mech serum. Hell, keep her around as she is just to take her away from the planet with her husband. I recognize you, OP, because of Ethan and Aisling. You always play with them (at least if you're the person I think you are)\n","\n","That was a place to start building your base. Not only it makes it defensible but is also... poetic. \n","\n","\"In the inhospitable, cold and snow-blanketed landscape, not a single soul around if not for a weary traveler who finds his way into a long, serpentine cave. Much to his surprise, he discovers a hidden, yet welcoming and warm palace of plenty\".\n","\n","I've got a few questions, though:\n","\n","1) What about Viking? He's one of your pawns, right? What made him worthy of joining Ethan and Aisling in their prosperous base?\n","\n","2) Did you build such a rich base with Ethan and Aisling alone?\n","\n","3) That northernmost room, the one between Ethan and Aisling's room and the study, with the pews and all that... is that meant to be the altar to a horrible deity you have yet to discover? That won't happen in the game, at least not in the current Vanilla, due to how temperature works in Rimworld.\n","\n","When dealing with temperatures, the game first acknowledges the outside temperature. Then it looks for rooms and apply the necessary variables (how insulated is this room? Is there any heat source/sink in this place? etc) and then come with a resulting temperature for each room. The game then keeps checking every room's temperature and the variables involved so it can change or keep temperature accordingly.\n","\n","If we were to have organic pawns emit heat to the immediate vicinity or to have a pawn in the outside be able to get warm by staying near a fire, this would mean the game would have to keep track of the temperature in every damn tile, and the resulting temperature mechanics would also be much more complex to simulate temperature in a decent, non-stupid way.\n","\n","\n","Let me give you an example: imagine a tiny, tiny map (200x200) with a huge colony (200 rooms. Have you ever seen a colony with 200 rooms?) and other 50 rooms created by ruins and ancient dangers.\n","\n","In such a situation, using the current temperature mechanics, the game would need to keep track of: outside temperature, plus the temperature of the 250 existing rooms (200 player-built + 50 ruins).\n","\n","This results in the game needing to keep track of 251 different temperatures.\n","\n","Now let's imagine this same situation, but this time suppose that the game keeps track of temperature in a tile per tile basis.\n","\n","Since the tiny map is 200x200, this means there are 40,000 tiles for the game to keep track of.\n","\n","So, you see? With the current temperature mechanics, the game would need to keep track of 251 different temperatures, against 40,000 different temperatures if such temperature mechanics were implemented, and that's considering a tiny map.\n","\n","This means the game would need a much, much bigger ammount of GPU power to run decently.\n","\n","I'm no coder, so there might be a way to work around this and make temperature processing more efficient, but I don't know. You can separate the prisoners.\n","\n","Instead of having a single prison with 15 prisoners, you may want to build several smaller prisons, each one dedicated to housing the prisoners dedicated to a specific kind of job. Ex: one prison for all the miner prisoners, another one for the prisoners who farm and cook, etc.\n","\n","I believe dividing prisoners into separate groups lowers the overall chance of jailbreak, but it's just an impression and I can't guarantee it's true. However, even if it's not true, there is another benefit to separating prisoners: whenever a prisoner starts jailbreak, he'll convince his fellows to follow him, but this affects only prisoners that are near him. So, you'll get small jailbreaks with only three or four prisoners, instead of 15+.\n","\n","Another idea is to... umm... treat your prisoners decently so they won't jailbreak? Haha\n","\n","When it comes to actually making a profit over slave labor I can't really help you, sorry. But, if you want to keep the mod's settings as they are (that is, with prisoners restricted to specific low-skill jobs), I would advise trying out to use your prisoners not for profit, but rather to free up your colonist's time so they can make a profit.\n","\n","Ex: use your prisoners to grow food for the animals and colonists and to mine stone chunks and cut them into blocks, so you can have your grower free to grow devilstrand instead of potatoes and hay, and your crafter free to make devilstrand clothing to sell instead of stone blocks. The trader ships only have interplanetary travel capabilities, so they can only take you to other planets in the system, which are also backward rimworlds just like the one you're living in.\n","\n","If someone wants to leave a rimworld for a glitterworld or even to a midworld or something, then he'll need a ship with interstellar travel capability.\n","\n","If you make it to Charlon Whitestone's ship, he'll tell you the ship reactor needs 15 days to properly power up until you can leave the planet. During this period, the ship will emit a very particular energy signature, typical of ships capable of interstellar travel, so you'll get a bunch of raids from pirates desperate to leave the planet. I think this is a good example of how uncommon interstellar flight capability is in the rimworlds and how people will do anything to get the chance of actually going somewhere else that's not a rimworld. Why so many people in power armor, though? Doesn't the work speed malus affect your colony? Well, that escalated quickly. Take a look at !linkmod: Animals Logic.\n","\n","It adds an option to prevent animals from randomly consuming things that are ingestible but not quite food, like drugs.\n","\n","It also adds a bunch of other features to help control animal behavior or to get some info on those animals. Yes, it is. As far as I know insanity reduces on its own, albeit at a very slow pace, but writing journals and the like in the typewriters help reduce it faster. Call of Cthulhu/Rim of Madness is actually a modpack. Call of Cthulhu: Straitjackets is the one that gives you straitjackets. If you want, you can download it and avoid the other, terribly evil mods that add unfathomable horrors of the most grotesque nature. That probably happened because of winter.\n","\n","You see, when you're travelling through tiles with temperate or boreal forests, tundra or really cold deserts, you need to account for seasonal weather.\n","\n","During the warmer months, travel is easier and faster, but as the temperature drops snow starts to pile up and slows travel speeds. In the world map, clicking on a tile and looking at it's data/stats will give you both a \"winter travel speed\" and a \"summer travel speed\".\n","\n","Such seasonal differences do not happen in tropical forests, extreme deserts or in (most deserts), as temperature is always way too high so there is no snow. They also don't happen in ice sheet and sea ice, as it's always way too cold and always snowing.\n","\n","A common mistake is to start a caravan trip in the beginning/middle of Fall and realize the trip back will be much longer since the temperature has dropped and snow has piled up.\n","\n","There are two solutions:\n","\n","a) I'm not sure this is vanilla, but the world map has a caravan simulator feature, which gives you a reliable estimate of how long the trip will be, give or take one day (unless you're taking a really slow pawn/animal with you, in which case the trip will take much longer than expected). Use it to simulate both the first trip and the return trip before you start forming your caravan, as it will account for seasonal changes and the slow travel that comes with the snowy months, predicting that the return trip will take way longer and allowing you to prepare accordingly.\n","\n","b) Travel only during the warm months. A bit too conservative of a solution but if you don't want to take risks that's the way to go. Usually this means travelling only from mid-Spring to late-Summer or early-Fall, but depending on how cold is your climate, fast travel might be possible only during a short span of a few days during mid-Summer, or even not possible at all. First of all: Thanks for the reply. I'm downloading some of those right away!\n","\n","But honestly, I don't know any mod that adds a decent ammount of content but are not yet in your mod list, so I don't really have a specific suggestion when it comes to that.\n","\n","If you do want to experience Rimworld from a different light, however, you may want to try out the Hardcore SK pack. It adds a much complex economy, with several production chains that you'll need to keep an eye at and long/intricate tech trees. It is particularly intensive both on Research and Crafting, so if you ever try it out I recommend start with at least one pawn that's decent in  each one of these areas, preferably not the same pawn for both of them.\n","\n","Content-wise, the modpack is not so big as the ones you already have. Most of the content it adds come from several different packs bundled together. For example, when it comes to humanoid races, the modpack includes the Orassans, the Norbals, the Asaris and the Nova. There are also a whole bunch of human factions. Also a few extra biomes, like volcanic fields (with lava and such), desert oasis and even archipelagos (not sure about this last one, might be another mod of mine). A bunch of new traits; countless new plants, crops, foods, drugs, etc. Many new diseases and health conditions, etc.\n","\n","There are also a whole bunch of QoL mods which will spoil you to death, allowing you to localize items lost in a 400x400 map in under 5 sec, for example.\n","\n","The biggest drawbacks, imo, are:\n","\n","a) it makes starting the game and loading saves really slow, though I haven't experienced in-game performance issues thus far; \n","\n","b) it relies heavily on Combat Extended, which some people dislike (not my case). Besides, there are a bunch of interesting mods that aren't compatible with CE, such as the Call of Cthulhu mods. (Cosmic Horrors can run alongside CE and the whole pack, but some of the monsters' stats will be fucked up; Factions is incompatible and causes a lot of bugs since Factions' weapons use stats different from the ones used by CE). \n","8376 ... i don't have a reddit account and i made one just to post this comment.\n","As a girl i must say you are so pretty!

I just read the article that you recommended and find it quite enlightening.  Time-in ... sitting with the child - I can see where that would be very loving and effective, except if he or she is acting out in an attempt to get attention.  In that case it might backfire causing more frequent episodes.  Also if a parent has other children to supervise, it might not be feasible to leave them unattended for several minutes.  The rule for time-out is 1 minute for every year of age; many people don't abide by this, mostly, I think, because they may not be aware of this guideline.  In that case the child could feel abandoned and suffer.\n","\n","Maybe we can be flexible in our approach combining both methods.  Sometimes an appropriately measured time out and whenever possible, a time in.  Parenting is so challenging!  It can really be exhausting and is never just black or white.  Your article really gave me food for thought.  Thanks! My heart goes out to you!  Since you \"have money\" you should, at the very least, get a mother's helper in for a couple/few hours a day.  It doesn't have to be a professional; I hired a neighborhood girl to entertain the kids and change a couple diapers, help feed them, etc., while I did other things that were piling up.  I don't know what to say about your self-absorbed hubby, except he sounds like a good provider.\n","\n","I know this feels like it's never going to end, but it will get better as time goes on, and you get a little help.

And also BTW, you say you have no education, but you're a damn good writer.

That's why we as parents have to teach them the appropriate social skills.  Have a nice day!\"  and then just walk away.  (If you stick around it sounds like she might embroil you in an arguement.) Welcome to the land of tantrums!  There's a great series on TheSandboxKids.com all about managing and preventing tantrums in young children. Check it out.  I think it might help.  The link for Part I is http://thesandboxkids.com/aggression-and-tantrums-in-young-children-part-i/  Best of luck! Dealing with tantrums is probably one of the very hardest parts of parenting, and it doesn't help to know that they're a normal part of childhood.  I publish a parenting website called TheSandboxKids.com about children under five.  I've just finished researching this topic and have published the 2nd of a 3 part series on it.  Please check out Part 2 in particular because there are several suggestions taken straight from child psychologists and other behavioral specialists in it.\n","\n","It sounds like a lot of the confrontations revolve around the high chair.  Maybe he's afraid of heights, or maybe he views it as being for babies and he's a \"big boy\".   A time out in a different spot might be more effective.  Taking away a privilege or a favorite toy for 24 hours might help.  Consistency and follow-through are key here.\n","\n","You might just have to pick your battles with your little guy.  It's possible he's feeling completely helpless and frustrated so he acts out ... maybe it would help if he feels like he has a tiny bit of control, like choosing what he wants to wear, or choosing if he wants to brush his teeth first and then get dressed, or the other way around.  Maybe he's kicking a book because he really wants you to read it to him.  He's just too young to \"use his words\" and ask for what he needs.\n","\n","If all else fails, it might be time to consult his pediatrician.  There are conditions like autism, ADHD, and other clinical conditions, or even food allergies that could be causing these symptoms.  Check out the \"Aggression and Tantrums in Young Children\" installments in the meantime.  The link to Part 2 is:   http://thesandboxkids.com/aggression-and-tantrums-in-young-children-part-ii/   I hope there's some advice in them that might help.  Best of luck! Getting a baby to learn the difference between day and night is pretty challenging, especially when they're brand new. I agree with all the other parents that, at one week old, swaddling is best.  It simulates the snugness of the womb.  But you will have to start teaching her how to sleep through the night, though, and there's no time like the present.  I've found the suggestions in an article on one of my favorite parenting sites to be really helpful for my 4 mo.  Take a read - the advice comes straight from the Mayo Clinic.  http://thesandboxkids.com/sleeping-through-the-night-a-good-nights-sleep-for-you-and-your-baby/  Hope this helps.  BTW, Congrats and Happy Holidays!  Best of luck. I agree that it may be the onset of separation anxiety, but it also might be time to go back to basics.  That's what I had to do recently with my younger daughter.  She experienced some regression as well.  I just came across a great website with a couple really interesting articles that may help.  One is about getting your baby to sleep through the night and the other is a video about emotional development in babies.  The page for the sleep advice is http://thesandboxkids.com/sleeping-through-the-night-a-good-nights-sleep-for-you-and-your-baby/   I hope this helps.  Good luck. Only you can tell what's right for your little one, but my experience has been that my younger daughter was just 1 week PAST the cutoff for Kindergarten, so she was the oldest in her class the following year.  It never seemed to interfere socially.  Academically she's always been at the top of her class, not because she was a few months older but because she's always challenged herself by taking on more and more work and never being satisfied with a B.  (When she was in 4th grade, she cried when she got a B.  I did counsel her about the drawbacks of being too much of a perfectionist at that time.)  Anyway, she's 25 now and teaches in an elementary school, but every now and then she still brings up the fact that she couldn't go to Kindergarten with the rest of her Preschool class.  Although it was no one's \"fault\" it does seem like it has always been a regret for her.  (Since every child is different, I hope this helps.) I'll never forget when my older daughter was born.  I couldn't wait to breastfeed her.  I had a vision of saintly motherhood with a halo over my head, until the first time she latched on.  OMG!!!  It hurt so-o-o much! I absolutely couldn't believe it!  But I stuck it out.  My milk came in, and she kept nursing, and it kept hurting!!  I couldn't understand why it hurt so much!  And then my nipples began to bleed a little around the sore edges.\n","\n","A cousin of mine had 2 babies already and had nursed them both for over a year, so I called her to get some advice.  It turned out that the advice was so simple, and yet so powerful!!  She asked me how I held my daughter when she nursed, and I said I held her like a cradle with her head in the crook of my arm.  Then I switched sides and held her the same way but in the other arm.  \n","\n","She said, \"That's your trouble right there!  You have to switch from that position to the 'football hold.' \"  I said, \"What the heck is that?!\"  And she explained:  if you're going to nurse from the right breast, hold the baby with her head in the palm of your right hand and lay her body straight on your forearm so that her feet are in the crook of your arm.  And then when you nurse from the left breast, hold her head in the palm of your left hand and let her feet be in the crook of your left arm.  This way the pressure is on a different part of the nipple.\n","\n","Well, when I did that, it was a whole other experience!  Completely pain free!!!  I couldn't believe it, and I went on to nurse her comfortably for a full year.\n","\n","When my second daughter was born 4 1/2 years later, I thought I would have to go through the pain again, but much to my surprise and relief, it didn't hurt at all, even from the first time!  So try switching your hold and see if that helps.  And once it stops hurting, try not to bottle feed too much because sometimes that interferes with the baby's desire for the breast, itself. Although babies learn a lot by interacting with a parent or older sibling, it's important for them to play by themselves, too.  When they're alone, they have time to \"study\" a toy and become more familiar with it, so it's a kind of learning time.  It's just like when experts tell you not to rush over to your baby as soon as you hear a whimper because he has to learn how to \"self-soothe\".  Solo play is the same thing.  AND let's not forget how important it is for you to get things done!  So to answer your questions ... no, babies don't need CONSTANT interaction, and letting him play by himself is a good thing ... it stimulates his baby imagination. \n","8385 I feel targeted!!!

Other than those 3, I see more of either the description in the books, or some of the fan casting I've seen on other sites. \n","\n","Agree with other poster on Cat, Michelle Fairley, along with Sean Bean were a bit older than I see them in the books, but the acting was spot on. Same with Rory McCann, he's great at acting the role, but I've always had a much different view of The Hound from the books. In general, I like that the show aged the children up, but IMO they went overboard with aging up the adult characters.  I don't really care about spoilers one way or the other. I've already read the books more than once and didn't feel like knowing what would happen to a character took away from my enjoyment of them on rereads. Still not sure if I'm watching Season 6, but spoilers are the least of my reasons.  The Khal has left the building. Shoulda been \"your grace\"  I remember the \"spoilers\" they posted about how the season would shake out, so it's either urban legend or a troll.  The show has diverged so far from the books, I can't take it as foreshadowing of anything in the upcoming novels. GRRM has stated several times that there would be no rapes of his main characters. I have a sneaking suspicion that he either hasn't shared the details of his story arcs with D&D, or if he has, they have chosen to ignore it anyway. \n","\n","I don't see much of anything happening between her and HtH, and unlike the show, she needs more than Littlefinger's powers to annul her marriage to Tyrion. I don't necessarily see their marriage as end game, but it's likely to serve as plot armor for quite a while.  I noticed both Sophie and Maise were listed, but none of the actors they're in scenes with. I've always taken anything from imdb with at least a bucket of salt tho.  Sounds interesting, but if it that happens it could end up as show only canon. He also never eats, sleeps or uses the privy in the books.

Which not only is the loot itself worth a ton, but the loot also serves the purpose of increases the speed of passive income? There is literally no downside. And it should auto highlight the price after you hit ‘add new offer’ Select the item upon filter, & highlight the price when selecting ‘place offer’ This is my least hated part about the skill, I don’t mind people can get to places that others can’t based on skill level. That unbalanced part of strength is the movement speed buff, with the server issue in this game alongside it makes some people almost impossible to hit. I mean, both iterations work I guess but I would definitely see more people pissed off your way. I love this idea, & I’m riding this stonk to the damn moon. Breeki Hands baby! You mean like holding down mouse 1 after firing a shot so it doesn’t load the next round immediately? Because that’s in the game. The 4/0 Qiyana stomps Akali after shroud 100%. 2/0 does for that matter will win. Her damage & single target damage is disgusting is nuts in itself but that’s what her role is. She isn’t designed to be a tank buster, & the only way you can really win that fight is with a conqueror build. \n","\n","I agree with the fighting in base part though, I wonder if there was a way for them to make it so she could change elements in base. That would really be a good quality of life change. This should be a post in its own IMO. Try it for a couple weeks and see what happens to player base & see people’s thoughts on it. \n","\n","The only people who are going to have problems are people doing these grab & butt stuff runs. I agree, the goal should be to not punish players for holding an angle, you should risk barging in a door with no sort of grenade or cover fire. Right now you can sprint into the room find your target & begin to strafe shooting at the guy who might of just seen you on his screen, while you’ve seen him for multiple seconds now. Yeah the skills themselves are a total different talk in my opinion. I specify strafe speed because with the net code as bad, that at least in cqb that the person who swings first gets to see his opponent longer than the guy who held the angle. \n","\n","By reducing the strafe speed by even 10-15% at the beginning you may have more chances to where the fight is close to being even in terms of time to react by hitting the first shot. I’ve always considered just reducing the strafing speeds in general to combat the peekers advantage for the time being that’s absurd. Reducing the strafe speed would not harm the game in anyway, CSGO did this years ago if I remember correctly. It don’t really look sus guys, go watch some CS pros accidentally hover over people through walls it happens a lot, that’s just how you play FPS games Bro I just found my 2nd flash drive in raid at level 27... I haven’t even unlocked Peacekeeper quest line yet... please let me craft that shit level one. I’d have intelligence 2 but the damn vitality skill is not my favorite to level lmfao I thought this was planned? They said they would implement moments for traders where they could not acquire goods so they would increase prices as a result. Like storms, or scav ambushes that would attack cargo trucks, stuff like that. This will definitely make the loot & economy of tarkov a lot more enjoyable to be apart of at any given time. Upvoted though so people see this! Get into FPV drones, this can be you. Me and my buddy spawned in to woods at 545 at Scav house and we seen the same Cultist Migration happen as well. There were so many of them, I killed all of them but never seen the boss. Is it confirmed he spawns with them every time if anyone knows? Electrocute is a must, and I run the lethality after a dash, zombie ward because roaming with her is pretty important so get sweeper early. Then you can do out of combat move speed or healing on your abilities. I pick either one of these depending really if I’m gonna roam a bunch. Second tree I go biscuit delivery & buff to potions in tough lanes, or triumph + coup if I think I’ll win lane easy. \n","\n","Start corrupting pot in normal match ups & long sword only if you feel real confident. But other than that she’s full lethality like any ad assassin. I like eclipse as the mythic but I’m gonna try more of prowlers claw, I think it could be really good on her. Umbral glaive & mobies or swifties if I’m roaming a lot too. Mostly full lethality though don’t really deviate. Your job is to kill high damage squishies so if you can’t do that you’re useless except ult. Once you get the hang of Q then resetting it with W she becomes almost a guarantee kill on any squishy. Plus the ult can literally win a team fight single handed. An assassin with a big team fight ultimate is a great pick for soloq. Qiyana trust me. That champion is so much fun & hits so hard Try smite if you haven't, or the game Predecessor when it comes out. They're similar, but Predecessor is a remake of Paragon if you ever played that. \n","\n","Me and buddies kind of got into smite recently over anticipation to it & it's actually pretty damn fun. You're moba experience will obviously make it easy to transition but what smite does differently especially in the ADC role is you have to literally aim & predict autos which I enjoy.

Assassin's normally in the jungle, with a few tanky/mage exceptions & the ADC does real damage towards the end of the game. Man your game looks amazing, the lighting specifically.

But instead Rito thought mages needed more health & survivability. \n","\n","ADCs need an hourglass item, make GA an active & every adc will make that into their kit just like almost every mid laner builds zhonyas. The tackle is an overlooked move in to new players to the GS. The great sword is perfect for what you're using it for, but what's better than the shoulder to get to the bigger hit? The slinger. \n","\n","The slinger also adds *mobility* to the GS. Making it to where you can redirect yourself if the monster moves out of TCS range. Another tip is when you shoulder you use stamina, but when you use your secondary swing you gain stamina. So using secondary attack after a shoulder can be aimed, & gain stamina at the same time. Then you can redirect yourself with slinger! \n","\n","[check this video ](https://youtu.be/IcLCSSHc1Z4) it explains everything with example! Where you are is pretty good id say, & you should consider upgrading those pieces with armor spheres because I would imagine until you get silver rathalos that is the best zet you will have.

But once you get to the guided lands, & Safi you will be in the market to upgrade. \n","\n","Safi will be available in about 2 week but you really should consider fighting Kulve Taroth.

I made the trade bc I need pitching as well as an upgrade over Castro asap. Thanks for the advice though!  10 team H2H 6x6\n","I have a potential trade offer where I would be sending away Hosmer and Melancon and getting back Odor, Maeda and either A. Jones/Mazara/Choo. I still have Rizzo and C Santana at 1B and have given up on saves. Odor would be an upgrade over Castro at my MI spot and the other two would definitely help my pitching and OF. Hosmer is a big piece to give up but with those others still at 1B I am very tempted. Thoughts? Thanks So I am currently 7-3 in my league but still looking to upgrade. I have Rizzo, Hosmer and Carlos Santana at 1B so I want to move one of these, and I have Cano, Castro and Murphy at 2B but am using Murphy at 3B so I want another 2B instead of Castro to use at the MI spot. I have a potential trade in the works of Hosmer and Gattis (I also have Lucroy at C) for Odor and Ozuna. I am very tempted because I would still be happy to use Santana at the corner infield spot and Odor and Ozuna would be upgrades at the MI spot and in the OF. Thoughts? This is a H2H league with 6 cats on each side. Thanks. Legend. Some of the best stuff out there.\n"," I would drop Reed and keep the other three, but its down to Reed and Watkins for sure. \n","\n","I think this is a very strange rule though.

Lurie leaving no stone unturned. [Pelissero] The Eagles are interviewing Cowboys OC Kellen Moore today for their head coaching job, per source. [Frank] JJAW ties his career high with two catches. [Frank] The Eagles are on pace to become the fourth team since 1950 to average 5.0 yards per carry but run the ball less than 24 times per game. [ESP] The Chiefs offensive line now has as many receiving touchdowns this season as the Eagles wide receivers do. [Philly's Mayor] The public events moratorium announced yesterday was specific to those requiring a permit—like festivals and parades. Sporting events will be determined by the team and City based on current guidance as COVID-19 evolves. The Eagles will continue to communicate directly with fans.

[Fowler] Teddy Bridgewater is expected to have a “strong market” in free agency and could land a multi-year deal, paying him around $30M per year [Bleacher Report] Matisse remembers the biscuits this time. [Kempski] Sources: Former GM Scot McCloughan has been an Eagles consultant for over three years. [Berman] Doug Pederson said on local Philly radio that if Jim Schwartz doesn't get the Browns job, he's \"definitely my defensive coordinator moving forward.\" [McManus] Eagles are currently 1.5-point underdogs at home against Seattle. If it holds, Philly would be an underdog in its 6th straight playoff game. Doug Pederson is 4-1 in the playoffs as an underdog. No other coach since 2016 has more than 1 such playoff win. [Hughes] Jets owner Christopher Johnson spoke to a group of reporters out at practice. He said there will be NO changes at head coach before or after season. Adam Gase will be back in 2020. No matter what. [Farzetta] Coaches Film on the infamous Agholor play show it was an easier catch to make than originally thought. [ESP] Agholor on his missed deep ball: \"I was trying to track it, the ball was already out of position.\" [McMullen] Alshon Jeffery says it wasn’t him behind anonymous quotes to Josina Anderson. [Spadaro] Coach Doug Pederson says that when they return “moving forward,” Ronald Darby and Jalen Mills will be the starters at CB. [Hill] Cowboys will not have Tyron Smith, Lael Collins, Randall Cobb, Amari Cooper, Byron Jones or Anthony Brown at practice today, in addition to putting Tyrone Smith on injured reserve [Gonoude] Most Scrimmage Yards Per Touch (NFL RBs in 2019, min. 70 attempts): 6.08 - Dalvin Cook (Min.); 5.99 - Matt Breida (SF); 5.97 - Miles Sanders (Phi.) [Eagles] Roster Move: Eagles have promoted RB Boston Scott from the practice squad to the active roster and placed RB Corey Clement on Injured Reserve. [Werder] In two Cowboys losses, Dak Prescott has four interceptions and Ezekiel Elliott and Jason Witten both lost fumbles. The defense has created one takeaway, meaning the Cowboys are -5 in turnover ratio against the only two quality opponents they’ve played. [Maddox] Everything is going well. Appreciate the prayers and get well wishes. God is good. 🙏🏽 [Frank] The last two visiting QBs to throw 3 TDs and 0 INTs at Lambeau and beat the Packers are Nick Foles and Carson Wentz.

I realized that it's not something that I could do at the drop of a hat. And that I'm human and I'm allowed to feel.  I'd want to know what used to be known as The Garden of Eden looked like at its peak of beauty. I imagine that would be scarring if you're watching it alone and something catastrophic happened. I don't really think you need the literature written by man to decide whether or not you believe in a higher power. But a seeing a miracle be performed *would* be an awesome thing to watch! I think Moses \"parting the red sea\" (what I think was the God making really crazy intense winds, parting the water - Mythbusters reference) would be absolutely insane.  Modern Family. Cam's cuffs on all of his blouses really bring joy to my life. Nerds. There's plenty of them, don't really like them all that much, and I wasn't planning on finishing anyway. The way I think of him \"pulling the race card\" here - which in this instance seems appropriate and damn near hilarious...it's the same thing that Chelsea Handler did in her recent interview. When you're interviewing a celebrity who's taking time to be with you in your segment you do your research, are polite, and on your toes. Especially with such large audiences those broadcasts have.  The ability to read minds. So that I wouldn't have to go through all of this anxiety. \n","   Tokens: ['Holding', 'on', 'to', 'the', 'back', 'of', 'the', 'prostitute', \"'\", 's', 'head', 'Have', 'you', 'gone', 'back', 'to',
